<h2 align=center> M01.23 - The Psychic Work Ethic leading to Zero,
<br> Judgment, Unfinished Business and the Big Bang. </h2>
<p>
<b>The meditational exercises in S01 to S07 are needed to make this section work. If things get too heavy, go back to S01 and work forward again. The information here may be in other parts of the site. </b>
<p>
<b> The effects of gods and religion appear far less significant after one has investigated the turkeys in M01.22. This opens the way to investigate work. </b>
<ul>
<li><b> Work </b> now appears as the top emotion, though like enthusiasm and anger or any other emotion, it does not pay to be permanently in it. We live in a sea of the fossilised works of our ancestors. If we wish to be free of the past, then we must use dynamic work on anything which disturbs our serenity. Dynamic work brings fossilised works screaming into present time. If you allow other people to do all your work for you, then you will be a slave in their universe.
<li><b> Psychic Work </b> deals with the antics of the Reptilian Brain, hopefully guided by the logical mind. When brought into real time, dynamic psychic work offers the possible achievement of all goals and desires.
<li><b> Realities </b> are the results of work. They too need to be kept dynamic through dynamic work. Realities from the past are our present day gods and religion, and need to be kept updated. The inference here is that realities create engrams, memes, zodiacs and astrologies.
<li><b> Work </b> creates and destroys gods, so some work of our own is called for. Trying to set oneself up as a god is a good way dealing with old fossilised gods.
<li><b> Psychic Engineering </b> deals with the use and misuse of work, the creation of new and the destruction of old realities. There probably always will be people who want all their work done for them, and are slaves as a result.
<li><b> Psychic Warfare </b> deals with the battles between works. Works which are dynamic and in real time have the advantage over fossilised works.
<li><b> We; </b> We, the gods; We, the people; etc. Expand one's universe. This will result in many delusions disappearing.
<li><b> Our Loyal Worshipers, Our Loyal Sinners, Our Loyal Gods</b>, etc. If you find people worshiping you, then by all means be their god. Please remember to collect the rent, by commanding them to thump your enemies and the enemies of National Security in the country in you live.
<li><b> Zero. </b> In an ideal state, no one is in distress or disturbed by old mentalisms. Thus the state above work is Zero. As we approach zero, so it becomes harder to write things up. It does not help that we are dealing with the antics of the Reptilian Brain by using the logical parts of the brain. Thus for more information, read the rest of this website for things leading up to this point.
</ul>

<div align=center>
<b> Judgment, Unfinished Business and the Big Bang. </b>
</div>
<ul>
<li> Minds work in similar ways to Internet trolls, who are at present causing much distress on Twitter. Trolls are anonymous and believe they can not be called to account. Gods and other such minds also believe they can not be called to account.
<li> Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle starts to reign supreme with minds being both in human bodies and existing as disincarnate at the same time. The truth is probably that in any one case, each is feeding the other, so it is a case of looking for the source. This is a case of circularity.
<li> The ultimate source is the Big Bang, memories of which have been interpreted and mis-interpreted, especially by priests and religions to justify their opinions. These opinions have evolved into modern religion. However there may be a source even further back which led to the Big Bang.
<li> &quot;The God gene hypothesis proposes that a specific gene (VMAT2) predisposes humans towards spiritual or mystic experiences (Wikipedia).&quot; This gene is alleged to exist in about 50% of the human race. When one is ready, this gene can be targeted as a mind, but we suspect it is not the only one.
<li> The concept that astrology is written on our junk DNA comes back to haunt us. We blame Jehovah for this one. Again astrology appears to exist both in our DNA and as a disincarnate entity, and can be targeted as either.
<li> It is most uncomfortable to be judged on the wrong moral code. Responsibility generally involves being prepared to be judged by one's own moral codes.
<li> The last Judgment is not a judgment on man, but a judgment on God or gods.
<li> He who sits in judgment sits at the top of the hierarchy and the top of the psychic food chain.
<li> Targeting the various aspects of <b> Judgment </b> drastically cuts down the uncertainty principle and clips the effects of all minds. If you are the judge, then no one can turn around and judge you. This a case of the survival of the fittest.
<li><b> Unfinished Business </b> is the main reason for existence in the Spirit World. A lot of what comes over in a Spiritualist meeting are apologies from people in the Spirit World, trying to rectify their failures in life. Gods have unfinished business, even Jehovah, Allah and the rest of the Elohim. We have even targeted the unfinished business of the Big Bang, which suggests that this event was not quite as described by physicists.
<li><b> The Big Bang </b> keeps coming up as the ultimate source of energy for minds and the ultimate weapon of war. It is the great source of social engrams. In theory there is only one Big Bang, but due its use by all and sundry, every religion and group has its own version.
<li> It may just be that the Big Bang as a super engram is pure illusion, with other engrams claiming to be the Big Bang, so no one dare touch them. However if one is prepared to take on the Big Bang, one can take on anything. It is a good long stop.
<li> The Big Bang like gods and engrams are only memories, even if they exist in the lost dimensions of Quantum Physics. They all need to be reminded that they no longer exist.
<li><b> Genetic Warfare. </b> Hit your neighbour over his head using the Big Bang as a baseball bat.
<li><b> Enlightenment. </b> The good news is that it is available as total control of everything on the Telepathic Net left standing. The bad news is that there is a branching hierarchy of telepathic nets.
<li><b> Appreciation. </b> Man is a sociable animal and he expects appreciation but does not always get it. There is a hint that lack of it drove Jehovah mad, resulting in certain human conditions.
<li><b> The Physical Telekinetic Big Bang </b> appears to be just a variant on so called Big Bangs to make things look even more ferocious than they actually are. Physical telekinesis when it does appear, seems to centre around 14 year old boys, and the writer has forgotten what it is like to be 14.
<li><b> Sidereal Time </b> refers to the time of day relative to the black hole at the centre of our galaxy. Psi is said to be at its most powerful when we are facing the centre of the galaxy. Unfortunately we have a 365.25 day calender, while the Earth revolves at 366.25 times per year. Thus the time we are facing the centre moves throughout the year (See Wiki). Thus information above on Big Bangs may not be that far fetched. We may be getting a weak sidereal download once per day.
</ul>
<p>
<div align=center>
<b> Sin. </b>
</div>
<ul>
<li> It is an incongruity that monotheists expect their God to forgive them their sins, but are not prepared to forgive the sins of their God. This should be a 2 way process. Sin is largely tied up with moral codes and not criminal law, and not even &quot;Do as you wish to be done by&quot;. Thus the concept of sin can be just another Tower of Babel. It appears important is to keep ongoing sin in check as this holds all past sins in place.
<li><b> Memes. </b> An analysis of the structure of memes is given in <a href="r11i.htm">Section M05..</a> which was written in February 2001. We see no great reason to change this. In a meme, the message and programming elements are all important, and are in the conscious mind.
<li><b> Engrams </b> are incident lost in the sub-conscious, and are similar but the emphasis is in programming the sub-conscious.
<li><b> Sin </b> is anything lost in the sub-conscious, which leads to guilt in the conscious mind and illogical behaviour for no logical reason. Most people can remember most things belonging to this lifetime and their current body, at least partially. This is responsibility and not sin. There are strong elements of advertising and distribution here. The victim is under a strong compulsion to attack and download the sin on to other people. Ongoing sin in present time is one of the main reasons why all other rubbish gets perpetuated. Sin produces a compulsion to sin and continue sinning. A major source appears to be the Elohim.
<li> <b>Astrology. </b> We suspect this follows a similar pattern. Watch out for Big Bangs protecting it.
<li> <b>Pain </b> is common to all engrams, memes and sin in various forms and in various amounts.
<li> <b>Creation Memes. </b> A self creating meme sounds like a complete incongruity, though as we can not explain the creation of the universe, it can not be ruled out. A meme which once created by a human or other intelligence, can draw on our intelligence to create additions to itself and grow, is not an impossibility. This could explain complex structures like zodiacs and astrology. Thus one can grow a god or an alter-ego.
</ul>
<p>
<div align=center>
<b> Check List. </b>
</div>
<ul>
<li> Big Bangs.
<li> Engrams, memes, zodiacs, astrologies, sins.
<li> The Quantum Physics of every engram, astrology, etc.
<li> Intrusive Thought (An annoyance to most people, but a major problem to anyone with psychiatric OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder)).
<li> Intrusive Thinkers (Track them back to source).
<li> My / our / your / every Quantum Physics, etc.
<li> Physical telekinetic Big Bangs, engrams, sins, etc.
<li> Everything too big to handle.
<li> Everything which no longer exists.
<li> Everything left standing.
<li> Telepathy, Telekinesis.
<li> If one can handle the Big Bang as a psychological entity, one can handle anything.
<li> Sidereal Big Bangs, sidereal engrams / zodiacs / astrologies, etc.
</ul>
<p>
<div align=center>
<b> Killer Goals and Memes. </b>
</div>
<ul>
<li> See <a href="d03j.htm">Section S03.. </a>Some simple drills, Reality and Hamlet. This deals with patterns of goals. Zodiacs are made up of chains of groups of goals. Astrology is made up of zodiacs.
<li> Here goals, memes and big bangs tend to merge and are interchangeable.
<li> Every zodiac and astrology group has a killer goal or meme to protect it, the effect of which can appear as terrible as the Big Bang. &quot;You dare touch me and I will kill you.&quot; This is an illusion to prevent one dismantling the zodiac involved.
<li> Allow for killer memes, killer goals, killer zodiacs, killer astrologies, killer brains, etc.
<li> Allow for telepathic goals.
</ul>
<p>
<div align=center>
<b> Physical Telekinetic Brains. </b>
</div>
<ul>
<li> We are coming to the conclusion that the most basic part of the brain is the Physical Telekinetic Brain, and that physical telekinesis is a weak force. On the physical side, this is more basic and older than the ordinary reptilian brain. On the psychic side, it is more basic than astrology and tends to create astrology.
<li> Presumably physical telekinesis has been stronger in the past, or this part of the brain would not have come into existence. Perhaps it is another explanation of swarm behaviour. It has been pointed out that the reflexes of birds are 7 times faster than ours, but that need not be the only reason for the behaviour of flocks of birds.
<li> At present physical telekinesis appears too weak to be commonly recognised. However it is strong enough to keep people interested in magic, fantasy and religion, and keep writers of such material in bread. Thus it has more effect on brains than in the common universe.
<li> Allow for Physical Telekinetic Brains and killer brains. This is capable of creating all psychic and mental activity.
<li> Allow for the Physical Telekinetic Work Ethic.
<li> Look at the Psychic Work Unit which is similar to the Unit of Consciousness.
</ul>
<p>
<div align=center>
<b> Above Work? </b>
</div>
<br>
In a world of universal (two way) love, there is little need for love. Love only becomes necessary when it is short supply, and thus we are approaching zero. Take a look at the worlds of:-
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Universal Love. 
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Universal Healing. 
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Universal Empathy. 
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Universal Responsibility. 
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Universal Anger. 
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Universal Psychic Warfare. 
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Universal Telepathy. 
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Universal Work. 
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Universal Human Condition.
<div align=center>
<br>
<b> A Universal Ragnarök </b>
</div>
<br> The Viking Ragnarök where man takes over from the Gods, and become as the Gods, applies only to the Viking religion. However we can extend this. Try variations on the following:-
<ul>
<li> Target &quot;Everybody / everything who disobeys us.&quot;
</ul>
Please note that this will only catch people and things on the Telepathic Net. If they are telepathing on the Telepathic Net, then they are undoubtedly trying to mind control you, getting you to do their will, or trying to obtain your complete obedience. Adolf Hitler also wanted your complete obedience. Why not be as the Gods. One is unlikely to affect any God involved in the Big bang, but then He is highly unlikely to recognise a man if he saw one. We do not recommend becoming a god, as first one has to die and preferably be mummified, and then operate from beyond the grave. This could be a fate worse than death.
<p>
<div align=center>
<b>The nature of God and gods has given us some problems.</b>
</div>
<ul>
<li> We may be at odds with certain intelligence agencies, but we are on the side of agencies in general. Thus we have been purging the malice of everyone who claims to be greater than the agencies. Thus we have been using the agencies as a substitute god. We expect both to protect us without getting in the way.
<li> To be or not to be part of the Universal Sub-conscious, that is the question. One answer is that the Universal Sub-conscious is there to be used. Being part of God can have drawbacks. We will opt for being separate from it and any matrix.
<li> Tribal gods like Allah and Jehovah can be dismissed as entities operating from beyond the grave. They have graves somewhere even if their remains have rotted away. Even Jesus Christ has his dark side; evangelists will give you a download of sin, so that you can be saved from sin, all in the name of Jesus Christ.
<li> Universal God becomes that part of the Universal Sub-conscious that represents all that we would class as universal survival.
<li> Universal Satan now becomes that part of the Universal Sub-conscious which represents self interest.
<li> Thus we have good and evil. However my good is liable to be your evil, and visa versa, so a balance has to be struck. Man is thoroughly evil from the viewpoint of infectious diseases. The two sides in conflict with each other become a problem.
<li> Universal Enlightenment comes when we say "Who cares!" to the problems of Universal Gods and Satans. Do they matter? Also enlightenment generally involves working out a balance between conflicting forces, none of which may be desirable.
<li> A Universal God becomes a good target to protect in meditation, as the ungodly usually claim to be greater than God, so He has His uses.
<li> This becomes a conflict between a Universal God and Universal Enlightenment.
<li> Universal Fire appears to resolve this conflict.
<li> The Universal God does tend to morph or transform into Universal (2 way) Telepathy, Universal Psychotherapy and a Mutual God.
<li> We still wonder if there can be telepathy above the emotion of boredom or contentment. Perhaps the emotions of interest and enthusiasm are just forms of psychiatric mania. In which case, they have served man rather well.
