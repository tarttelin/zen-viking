<h2> The Universe of Dowsing.</h2>

<b>The meditational exercises in S01 to S08 are needed to make this section work. If things get too heavy, go back to S01 and work forward again. See <a href="index-meditation.htm"> the Index of Meditational Exercises..</a>The information here may be in other parts of the site.</b>

<b> Dowsing </b><i> is a type of divination employed in attempts to locate ground water, buried metals or ores, gemstones, oil, gravesites, malign 'earth vibrations' and many other objects and materials without the use of a scientific apparatus. Wikipedia </i>
<p>
We have never been that successful at dowsing, and would like to improve this area.
<p>
So we have 3 states of Meta-Consciousness.
<ol>
<li> Dowsing which deals with the perception of non-human objects.
<li> Doingness which keeps Beingness in order, and is largely based on Telepathy.
<li> Beingness. There is a theory as old as time. If God can create the Universe, and as Man is created in his image, then Man can create. Some creations are useful such as the law to drive on the same side of the road. Telepathy tends to be the energy involved in the Creation and Destruction of Beingness. There is no perceivable connection between Beingness / Doingness and the Physical Universe, except via Man. Beingness is very energy hungry for any energy. Beingness claims to be king, and demands tribute in the form of energy.

<b> Quantum Physics </b> tells us that at the time of the Big Bang, there were 10 dimensions, 7 of which collapsed leaving 3 dimensions plus time. It is our contention that the lost dimensions disappeared from view, but are still there even if they are hard to observe. Thus there is plenty of room for Telepathic Waves and Dowsing Waves. Those people who want to turn Science into just another religion, will disagree with us.
<p>
<b> Gaia and the Living Universe </b> are worth considering. However the concept depends on everything generating and radiating an energy field, which leaves the question &quot;Where does the energy come from.&quot;. We believe the Laws of Conservation of Energy are still valid.
<p>
<b> The Radar </b> Principal where we radiate the energy, which is radiated back from objects of our selection. This sounds more valid.
<p>
<b> Tools and Reliable Indicators. </b> Tools include forked hazel twigs, pieces of wire generally from coat hangers, one's hands and one's eyelids. In fact anything that can amplify body twitches to give a reliable indicator.
<p>
<b> Meditational Exercises. </b> The best we have come across so far involve spontaneous abreaction. Probably the best exercise is to join a dowsing society.
<p>
<b> The life Force</b> is worth inspection. In modern science, the boundary between the living and the dead is somewhat blurred. Evidently viruses can be created in the laboratory, How were the first life forms on Earth created?
<p>
<b> Cautionary tail</b> from BSD (British Society of Dowsers). A group of dowsers got together to discover the theory behind dowsing by means of dowsing. Every time they converged on an answer, the theory changed, and thus they could not come to a conclusion.
<p>
<b> Solutions. </b> We have a problem. The available evidence says we are wrong. However over the years we put crashed psychics back on course, which says we are right. The probable solution is that we are dealing with numerous wavelengths and amplitudes of the same energy.
