<br> Index Military Remote Viewing - CRV</h3>
</div>
<p>
<b>Viking Remote Viewing (Military Paranormal). </b>Remote viewing is a new name for an old ability. Remote viewing is the ability of a person to project their conscious observation to a distant location to see or sense what is there. Distance is no object as even the stars are within reach. It was rediscovered and used by the Russians in the 1960s. The Americans rediscovered it around 1970. Now every other intelligence agency is using it to flesh out data from other sources. Remote viewing violates all the moral codes of science and religion. The occult and black magic are now obsolete, and both are past their sell by date. Remote viewing can be classified as either psychokinetics or a secular path to enlightenment or both. Be your own X-file investigator.
