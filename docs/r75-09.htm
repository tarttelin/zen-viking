<p>
<h3> The Sea of Memory. </h3>
There is a great sea of memory out there, outside all living people. This is a product of the unfinished business of the dead. Thus one can have any past life one chooses. These are memories waiting for a host. This is a great source of material for the Acquired Memory System, religion and the occult. Remember that the dead and their memories need the energy and intelligence of the living to activate them. Anger is a great cleanser. The living are greater than the dead, regardless of what they say.
<a name="magic"></a>
<p>
<h3> The basic Laws of Magic,
<br> The Psychology of the Sub-Conscious Mind. </h3>
<ul>
<li> The magic described here is quite secular, and is the psychology of the sub-conscious mind or the psychiatry of the primitive reptilian brain. As the conscious mind has trouble understanding the workings of the sub-conscious mind, they are classified as magic by the conscious mind.
<li> All acts of magic must be performed new each time and from the heart. Any second attempt will invoke a meme or memory of the first occasion, and thus will not work. To get around this, one must constantly vary procedures.
<li>Intention or lack of counter-intention is all important. Necessity can act as intention.
<li>Do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself. Using the black stuff rebounds on the sender, and limits his ability.
<li>Make sure one is clear about one's objectives.
<li>Take responsibility for any unexpected results. As they say, "Be careful what you wish for, as you might just get it". This is especially true when dredging up the thought forms of yesterday.
<li>Magic works in the Universe of thought or telepathy, and thus on human beings. Any effect in the physical universe is very hard to prove.
<li>A bit of magic usually needs a bit of ritual as a front end, and another piece of ritual to close it. Ritual does nothing but it does set the scene. Christians commonly use the Lord's Prayer as this type of ritual, but it is used too often to be anything else but ritual.
<li>Crystal balls, tea leafs, and tarot cards are good thought breakers, which makes a person think afresh each time. A bit of theatre or sense of wonderment can have a similar effect on those watching, also known as "Waking up the audience".
<li>The dead and other thought forms from the past need your energy and intelligence to activate them, as they are dead.
</ul>
<a name="targets"></a>
<h3> Targets for remote viewing.</h3>
<p>For those prepared to do a bit of pillage and rape, there are plenty of terrorists and hackers out there, and their Fascist religions waiting to enslave you. Clip their wings and neutralise them with remote psychotherapy. The Police may prefer to make arrests, but the latest cost of prison according to the Ministry of Justice is &pound;33,000 per person per year. Clipping their wings is far kinder to the taxpayer, and probably also to the target.
<p>
Then there are the email tappers. Email tapping by MI5 and the Police is hard to detect, as they employ professionals who do not have a hidden agenda, and therefore they are not psycho-hazards. However there are plenty of people using RIPA (Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2001) email tapping for their own religious, political and trade hidden agendas. They are psycho-hazards, and are the easiest people to remote view if they are reading your email.
<p>
Ladies who think all this not their style, should get their boyfriends to do it for them. It is the duty of every man to protect his women folk.
<p>
<a name="integration"></a>
<h3>The Integration of various parts of the brain.</h3>
You are on your own on this one. Can one think using the reptilian brain? It appears to be a case of using &quot;I, the reptilian brain,&quot;, &quot;We, the various parts of the brains&quot;, &quot;We, the universal mind&quot;, or just &quot;We&quot;. Let intuition be your guide. There may be a possibility of expanding psychic abilities, but this is also the area of God the Destroyer.
<p>
<a name="source"></a>
<h3>The Source.</h3>
In many cultures there are folk memories of an ancient super race, and their civilisations which are now extinct. They have various names like the Elohim, Nefilim, Atlantians and Lemurians. Now if such a civilisation had access to telepathy, remote viewing, illusion and delusion, then there would be little need for technology as we know it. They would also give their victims plenty of reason for killing them or at least avoiding them. They could make a cave look like a palace, and thus were expert at enslaving others. All civilisations fail when they become degenerate, and perhaps their use of slaves led to their degeneration. Candidates known to science include the Denisovans and Neanderthals, but there have been plenty of other races of man which no longer exist. Some are included in our blood ancestors, while others are not.
<p>
Now the limitations of computers are governed by their architecture using serial operation of bits which can be either on or off. Similarly human thought is limited by the architecture of our brains.  If the brains of members of lost civilisations were wired up in a slightly  different architecture to our own, they would have had different ways of thinking and different abilities to ourselves. Perhaps mercifully, we will never understand schizophrenic technology, but they did and left their psychic machinery behind.
<p>
A common thread in folklore is that they were so advanced that they gave up meat bodies and adopted etheric bodies instead.  Now the rude name for an etheric  body is Vampire, as they need the living to continue their existence, to provide thinking capacity and energy.  If one forgives the original source whether it it is in the Spirit World, Lost Dimensions of Quantum Physics or just the Sea of Memory, then all the Machinery of the Universe dependent on it will come crashing down, and Man will have to think for himself.
<p>
Thus if we target the Original Sinner or Original A******e, and forgive them their sins, we should get there eventually. However this does not appear to account for astrology. Obviously with its reference to the planets in the Solar System, astrology was generated on Earth. However the obvious may be wrong, as the Original Astrologer appear to precede the Original Sinner. That does not stop us forgiving the sins of astrology and the original astrologer, or what ever created it.
<p>
Nowadays we concentrate on the obsolete creations of yesterday past their use by date, in the role of God the Destroyer, and target engrams, memes, zodiacs, astrologies, creators, sources and obsolete loyalties.
<p>

<h3>Mind Maps.</h3>
A Mind Map of the human brain is the master view a person has of the universe in which they live. It is their view of the physical universe as filtered by their engrams, astrologies, schizophrenias, illusions, delusions, and memories real or imagined. It is thus a bridge between the secular and the occult, and is a basket for all mental rubbish from the past. It is a short cut to thinking, essential for fast thought and automatic reactions. Loki does have his uses. However it does need to be kept up to date. They control what you are allowed to think and do.
<p>
There is plenty on conscious mind mapping on the internet, but this is the bigger picture and tends to be a psychological side of the Science of Perception. However even master mind maps have to follow cycles of creation - Create, Change, Destroy. Destruction at this level can handle astrologies. In S08 - <a href="http://www.viking-z.org/d57.htm">Current RV model..</a>, replace &quot;Total Free Reincarnation&quot; with &quot;Total Free Creation / Change / Destruction&quot;.
<p>
Now Jesus preached Forgiveness, healing and love. We have been looking at mind maps to see if the 2 sides can be combined. Test the following.
<br>
<b>Forgiveness of Sin</b> wiped out Mithras and the Greek and Roman Gods. It worked marvellously well when no one bothered to define what sin was, which is in line with modern psychotherapy. Then along came the Church and defined sin and morality, and the work of JC has not been the same since. This a case of sorting out logic.
<br><b>Healing</b> is an emotion of the reptilian brain. Now if one's sub-conscious emotions are in order then one's emotion of healing should be able to heal one's own body. Thus the trick in healing another person is to insure their emotions are in order especially healing.
<br><b>Love.</b> In a state of total love, morality and ethics are irrelevant. Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. In Eastern religion, this becomes the virtuous path of right living. In a state of total love, anarchy prevails. JC never preached anarchy, but is probably the biggest anarchist of all time.
<p>
<br>Now if we convert these into mind maps we get at least 3.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Logical Mind Maps.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emotional Mind Maps of the reptilian brain emotions.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moral Mind Maps.
<br>Reality Mind Maps also look possible, so this list is incomplete, and the limit is governed by one's imagination.
<br>While there is little or no evidence for Physical Telekinesis in the Physical Universe, Telekinesis is a powerful for destruction and cleaning of thought in the Universe of Thought. There is little or no evidence of the Universe of Thought being able to operate in the Physical Universe, except by using man as an intermediary. Thus Telekinetic Mind Maps are worth a look.

<h3>Strengths & Weaknesses of Remote Psychotherapy.</h3>
<ul>
<li> It is subject to the Law of Diminishing Returns.
<li> People in distress telepath, while people in a quiet state of mind tend to receive telepathy.
<li> The usual causes of distress are that people have an overload, or that they are villains who do not wish to be found out.
<li> Any telepath can be hijacked and used as a slave to work on a third party.
<li> It is the survival of the fittest.
<li> If people know that other people are doing the work, then they mistakenly believe that they do not have to do anything.
<li> People are quite content to sit back and leave things to a "Messiah".
<li> While every little bit helps, the emphasis may be on the word "Little". However one should be able to punch well above one's weight.
<li> It is remarkably hard to change the mind of someone who is paid to be the way they are.
<li> The weakest part of any hierarchy is its apex.
<li> Remote Psychotherapy may be better at releaving the stress of the victim rather than changing the mind of the target.
<li> It probably works best when there are many therapists involved, preferably a large chunk of society.
<li> This sort of work gets no praise when things go right, and all the blame when things go wrong.
<li> Partial success is liable to be seen as complete failure.
<li> Some of the best potential targets are the superior officers of the remote psychotherapists.
<li> Some of the best current targets are obsolete religions.
<li> Targets also include amateur email tappers who have a personal agenda, and who have not done anything to clean up their minds.
<li> There is plenty of rubbish from obsolete religion and race to clean up.
</ul>
<p>
<a name="hiearchy"></a>
<h3> The Hierarchy of Telepathy.</h3>
<ul>
<li> Physical Telekinesis is at the top, and involves moving objects in the Physical Universe by means of thought. There is very little evidence for its existence. This may be because it does not exist, or because it takes up so much psychic energy as to make it uneconomic. The movement of genes and chromosomes looks the most promising area for proof. There is plenty of propaganda to protect the guilty to convince you that it exists.
<li> Remote Schizophrenia. This is the stuff of religion, race and politics. To comment further can be blasphemy, heresy and highly illegal. Expect plenty of telekinesis to protect the guilty. Schizophrenia must convince everyone that they are sinners, and this can only be forgiven by strictly following the rules of the religion.
<li> Remote Telekinesis is the Shock and Awe element of Telepathy. It involves the movement of mental objects in the Universe of Thought. It involves the good, the bad and the ugly, and is probably the highest active emotion of the reptilian brain. It is a good target to clean up, as it contains all the bully boy rubbish of yesterday.
<li> Remote Psychotherapy involves psychoanalysis at a distance. This is good for cleaning up all mental rubbish. It works best when the target is in a state of distress or has an overload.
<li> Remote viewing involves looking at people and objects at a distance by telepathic or psychic means. This is the ability favoured by intelligence agencies, as it does nothing to disturb the target. However the remote viewer must be on a level of psychic cleanliness above that of the target, otherwise he is liable to download his mind on the target, which gives him away and causes great offence to the target.
<li> Telepathy involves the transfer of thought from person to person in the Universe of Thought. It is a product of the reptilian mind, and the higher conscious mind is not involved. People in distress tend to telepath their thoughts. People in a quiet state of mind tend to receive telepathy.
<li> Most Psychic activity can be explained in terms of telepathy.
</ul>

<h3> A View of Schizophrenia, Apocalypse, Telekinesis and the Epileptic Fire Flow.</h3>
<ul>
<li> Schizophrenia tends to be a hierarchy with the successful ones at the top, like political and religious leaders, into whose dreams we buy into. The unsuccessful ones are at the bottom and are only of interest to the psychiatrist.
<li> Schizophrenia is the result of too much creation without enough destruction of creations which are past their use by date.
<li> This is a hierarchy of mind control and charisma.
<li> It is also a hierarchy of vampirism.
<li> Both religion and psychotherapy tend to shift a person away from bi-polarism towards schizophrenia.
<li> An interest in people is an aid to schizophrenic success.
<li> Being connected to the physical universe is an aid to keeping schizophrenia in order.
<li> Watch out for the games people play. This is a great area for playing games on the unwary, for sympathy, control and other reasons.
<li>
<li> The natural psychological remedy for too much creation is Apocalypse, when creations collapse under their own weight, and look ridiculous.
<li> Everything can have its own apocalypse.
<li> This leads on to the Master Apocalypse or Apocalypse of Reptilian Brains.
<li> The natural body remedy to schizophrenia is the Epileptic Fire Flow. Epilepsy is a flow which will burn up all excess mental creations if it is not blocked. Blocking this flow leads to fits and medical epilepsy.
<li> This is where the Epileptic flow meets Telekinesis, and they appear to be 2 sides of the same coin.
<li> Surt makes a good god of both epilepsy and telekinesis. He is violent enough.
</ul>

Perhaps we should be talking about Remote Operations and not Remote Viewing.
