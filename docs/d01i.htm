<h3> S01. Conscious Walking </h3> 
</div> 
<p> 
Contemplating one's navel is no way to try remote viewing. 
<p> 
Out East, training masters make much money, out of teaching western students to do conscious walking. The principle is that the mind cannot do two things at one time. Therefore by doing something consciously, one disrupts the patterns of the mind, and so make them visible to one's consciousness. The Eastern method concentrates on consciousness of the body. Thus each movement is consciously controlled. The placing of each foot on the ground, is a deliberate movement, and the more body movements that can be made consciously, the better. Feel the pavement through the feet. Do not be satisfied, until every movement is consciously controlled. There is a great deal of merit in this approach.
<p> 
Our preferred variation, is to put ones full attention, on to the environment, that is on the walls, trees, bushes, and whatever is around. It is as well to pick a suitable spot for the walk. This can be a remote spot, where there is no one to see or hear one. The other alternative is beside a busy main road, where people are too busy driving to take much notice, and there is too much noise for anyone to hear. Getting into full perception of the environment, can be a difficult lesson to learn. The first thing to meditate on, is what conscious walking is.
<p>

<p> 
There are various methods of getting ones full perception on to what is around. On a road, spotting the makes and models of cars, can be useful, especially if one says the make and model, out aloud. If any one else gets too near, then keep quiet. When crossing the road, concentrate on crossing the road safely. If anyone gets knocked down while doing this, they have failed the test. A person has also failed the test, if anyone asks if him if he has seen a psychiatrist. There are plenty of other things to observe, besides cars. Point out to oneself the various objects around, animal, vegetable or mineral, and name them.
<p> 
The more a person can consciously perceive the environment, the more rubbish will appear from the mind, and this can be abreacted off with laughter. Other lessons to be learned, are how to laugh with the mouth shut, and how to say things under one's breath without moving the lips. It is also advisable to walk, on the pavement against the flow of the traffic, as abreaction can cause motor cyclists to stop and inspect their machines, to find out what is wrong.
<p> 
A good Western alternative for meditational purposes and not remote viewing, is army square bashing, or parade ground drill. As long as the drill sergeant's comments are well and truly over the top, they are unlikely to do any harm, while the discipline is therapeutic.
<p> 
<b> Abreaction is the difference between what one intends and reality. laughter is one of its forms.
<br> Conscious walking is essential to reorganise the mind.</b>
<p> <b> Practice conscious walking, and consciousness of the environment, until one understands what conscious walking is all about</b>
<p>
<b> Ladies have emailed in to say this is complete rubbish. Conscious Housework works far better than Conscious Walking. Thus any form of conscious work can be considered provided it works. </b>

<p> 
<b> THE ZONE. </b> Whoever said &quot;I think, therefore I am&quot;, was a fool. Beingness is a function of mind and is not in real time. Verbal and pictorial thought is best used only for real purposes and real planning. We shall bring Moses up to date. &quot;Six days shall you labour and do all your work, and on the seventh day you shall think&quot;. Top athletes now talk of being in the zone. The zone is a state of no verbal or pictorial thought. In the zone, they can make best use of their ability and training and nothing can go wrong. Ordinary thought cripples ability. When they are not in the zone, they tend to fail. This is very similar to the states of mind favoured by Japanese martial arts experts.
<hr>
<p>
<b> The following is for people want a little extra help. </b> 
<p> SOLVE YOUR PERSONAL PROBLEMS. All people have problems. To a person who has his emotional affairs in order, these are challenges, posed by two or more things being in conflict with each other, and the conflict is quite obvious. When problems crowd into one's own universe, then even the solutions can be in conflict with each other. The solutions can conceal the original problem, at which point it becomes a personal problem.
<p>
To solve one's personal problems, take some blank sheets of paper. Write a personal problem across the top each. Underneath each problem, list out all the possible solutions. Do not leave out the anti social solutions, like murder, bank robbery (for shortage of money), or prostitution. They may be applicable. Go on until one has listed every possible problem, and every possible solution. At this point, one will be free of all personal problems, and will probably go high with elation. Freedom from personal problems is an emotional experience, and thus can only be experienced once. Once successful, do not try it a second time. Overdone spirit exercises, put a person back to where he started. This rule often causes trouble to regular churchgoers.
<p>
WRITE YOUR LIFE STORY. Dealing with personal responsibility for one's actions will take rather longer than personal problems.
<ol>
<li> Take a ring folder, and a pad of paper suitably punched to fit the ring folder. Take a sheet of paper, put your then age or the date of the area, you are currently inspecting, in the left hand column, and what you did at the time across the rest of the page. 
<li> Try to start with the earliest incident you can recall, and work forward in time. 
<li> Old incidents can be inspected, and evaluated in real time.
<li> No incident may be written down more than once. 
<li> It may take about 3 days for memories requested from the subconscious, to surface into consciousness.
<li> If an incident need to be rewritten, then throw away the original notes on that incident. This is not a case of writing 100 lines, &quot;I must not pull girls' pigtails&quot;.
<li> Should a person doing this, start putting down, what others have done to them, then they will dope off, or go to sleep.
<li> Make up the book from the earliest incident one can remember up to the present day. Pages can be inserted as required.
<li> Continue until one can take responsibility for all one's actions. If one goes high with elation, that is a sign to stop.
</ol>
<p>
In this way, it is quite easy to psychoanalyse one's self. One can do without the high cost of an analyst. There is also no analyst to explain wrongly, the meaning of everything. As one gets older, so the earliest incident one can remember, gets later and later. Thus a child can often remember back to birth, while someone in middle life may not be able to remember anything before the age of 10 years. This has lead analysts to say that psychoanalysis is useless for anyone over forty years of age. This is an admission that their techniques are somewhat crude. One just has to use higher spirit exercises as well to get the same result. It is quite easy to over run this exercise. However there are plenty of other exercises in this book. Avoid writing anything down twice.
<p>
HELPING OTHER PEOPLE. Abreaction is a psychological term for the release of repressed emotion. Some emotions like tears and anger are difficult to discharge on ones own, but help is quite easy. Laughter is easier to discharge. In the case of material from the Pit however, abreaction may clear the room, and is best done on one's own. Form or join a small group of like minded people, who are prepared to help each other in spirit development.
<p>
To help a person to discharge or abreact old emotional charges, the following is useful. Get the person to verbally list all the things he can currently remember doing. This is from the earliest memory, up to the age of fourteen or puberty, in chronological order. Do not go further than puberty without a person's permission. After puberty, sex may cause embarrassment. Anyway, most of the root damage is done before the age of fourteen. Keep them going with plenty of acknowledgement and &quot;what did you do next&quot;. Keep them on the things they have done, and away from the actions of others, except for reasons of context. In the case of war veterans and similar cases, one must do two things. One is to listen to their experiences, and the other is to get them to describe their early life, for that undercuts later traumas. War veterans are useful types to have around as they know when discipline is needed, and when initiative is needed.
<p>
If they dope off or get sleepy, get them to describe in detail, the last object or place they mentioned, by claiming ignorance of it. In the case of tears or other emotion, just let them outflow, and then get them to repeat the telling of the incident, without any comment, until the incident is discharged.
<p>
A very difficult lesson to learn, is that under no circumstances what so ever, should one comment, or express an opinion, on the problems of the person one is helping. Other people's opinions will not be appreciated, and are likely to be wrong 99% of the time anyway. After all it was probably good advice, which put the problem there in the first place. People are very much more robust, and easier to help, after they have taken a public speaking course. Keep one's opinions of others to oneself. Important as they may be to one's Ego, they are of very negative interest to other people. General group discussion will give everyone a better understanding of what is wanted by other people, and how best to help them.
