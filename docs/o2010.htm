<h1>Snippets from obsolete pages 2010</h1>
</div>
<p>
<b> Problem Solution Chains. </b> Today's solution to yesterday's problem tends to become tomorrow's problem. Thus there tends to be long chains of problems and their solutions. These can be such things as wars, peace treaties, and the next war that peace treaties create. These chains stretch back in time, the time limit depending on one's boggle barrier. Subject to one's boggle barrier, these may start on other planets. There seem to be no limits, but do they matter. All religions have the statement that God created order out of chaos, but unfortunately both the gods and their solutions are now past their sell by date

<p>
<b> Wagering one's head. </b> There is a constant battle between akashic entities, where they wager their heads against each other to see who is top dog. The loser ceases to exist as a psychic entity. There is reference to this in the Viking Sagas, where the gods wager their heads with older obsolete gods and win. We are living beings, so when we do it, the loser loses a chunk of obsolete mind. This keeps karma and akasha moving forward in time, and helps clean it up. However if we choose to be outside the system, and wager our heads with the system, the result is that the system is slimmed down. In practice this means challenging all offending parties to wager the graves of the dead, or their blood ancestors. Psychiatrists would probably prefer reference to wagering alter-egos, which has similar roots. Blood ancestors are a principle cause of schizophrenia. What makes schizophrenics so hard to cure is that what ever they say, they do not want to be cured. They just want a more comfortable life, and will wager their blood ancestors against anyone who tries to cure them. There is plenty of sub-clinical schizophrenia about. However to deal with other people's blood ancestors, one does have to deal with one's own.
<p>
<b> Longstops </b> are always useful. Entities are liable to tell one &quot;You can not touch me as I am authorised by the Source&quot;, so one has to purge the Source as well. Our favourites are the Galactic Federation and the Galactic Federation Supreme Court. These may be real or imagined, but purging these does mean that one is is prepared to go to the absolute limit. Authorisations usually turn out to come from blood ancestors and can be very important.
<p>
<b> Reality Maps. </b> The ego contains a person's map or view of the universe and reality, and if this map is corrupt, then a person is liable to have problems. The moral here is that one should be constantly amending and updating one's view of reality in line with the physical universe. Reality maps tend to collapse when one has a spell of enlightenment as in Buddhism, and one has to rapidly restore one's reality based on the physical universe.
<p>
<b> The Original Creation or Original Transmigration of Souls </b> is the Jewish take on what we have called the Penal Colony, and is another view of the same thing. The immortal souls in question are incapable of forgiveness, and yet desperately crave it. These vampires can only achieve peace by being forgiven. As the sins involved are over 6,000 years old, there is little point in refusing to forgive, and plenty of point in forgiving them to put them at peace and so get rid of them. In law, there are various statutes of limitations, and all personal legal liability ends with death.
<p>
<b>Astrology </b> looks a very man made system, so the probability is that it was either made by man or by ETs. It only applies to the Solar System in its known form. If one looks at the primary Zodiac, it has twelve houses to fit star systems in the sky, as viewed from Earth. Our findings are that it is another god machine, based on the graves of the Greys, with those concerned working from beyond the grave. They appear to have graves on the exoplanets such as Pluto and Chiron, which form the base of astrology. Any grave on Mercury, Venus and the gas giants would not last long, as they would be either incinerated or mangled up in a high gravity gas field. This just leaves the Earth, Moon, Mars and the exoplanets. Graves on the exoplanets are least likely to be found.
<p>
Now the Greys are very logical and have a survival problem mainly due to a lack of genetic variation. Thus a system of variation like astrology is very logical to them. Man has a very diverse genetic variation, and so one more system of variation is just illogical. Most men prefer free will, though not all, and some people prefer free will for themselves but predestination for other people. This is all logic based, left hand side of the brain stuff, as opposed the the right hand emotional side of the brain. The Fires of Purgatory blow hot, while the Fires of Logic blow cold. No doubt numerous astrologers have added to the system, parked themselves after death on various planets. What is written in S02 and S03 concerning zodiacs and the chains of goals which makes them up should still apply, but here we are trying to take an overview. One's meditational procedures may need updating to deal with logical material.
<p>
It is just possible that the exoplanets were convenient places for cemeteries for Grey space casualties, and the astrological system grew up by accident and not by design.
<p>
<b> God Machines. </b> The best known one is the Black Rock of Mecca, which gives an emotional download to all who visit it (non Muslims not allowed). It is not the only right hand brain god machine. The Communion of God Machines includes both the logical and emotional, left and right brained. Thus if one targets the Communion of God Machines, it is like putting a few tom cats in a sack and shaking it, thus forcing them to fight each other for survival. Tell them that only one can survive.
<p>
<b> The Reptilian Brain. Might is right </b> is the main line of thought of the primitive reptilian brain at the base of the skull. There is little indication of logical or emotional thought. It includes the pineal body and is source of telepathic communication. It is also the operating system which controls both the left hand and right hand sides of the brain, and can override both. Thus there is little logic or emotion here, only brute power, with the survival of the fittest taking command. The reptilian brain appears to be the seat of intention, and when intention becomes fossilised, it becomes raw power. It also appears to be the seat of telepathy. Necessity and intention are closely connected and may be one and the same.
<p>
Thus if someone sends you a telepathic download, and your defences are not good enough, that download will take effect. There is a good analogy here with computers. Most people use anti virus protection. If a computer goes crazy, then most people switch it off and restart it. Being able to switch off parts of the brain and restarting them may be an aid to flexible thinking, intelligence and genius; every little bit helps. The left hand side of the brain may control logic, language and mathematics, while the right hand side controls emotion and imagination, but the reptilian brain controls both.
<p>
<b> Schizophrenic Technology </b> is based on the technologies of the dead in association with the reptilian brain. Mercifully this can not be studied academically as it disappears on inspection, and can only work sub-consciously. Jehovah was the great past master of schizophrenic technology, and thus established himself as the Lord God Almighty. The writer is still unsure whether the Galactic Federation Supreme Court is fact, illusion or delusion. This could be galactic religion or the galactic inquisition. This could also be the case of psychic entities claiming so much authorisation that no one can dismantle them.
<p>
<b> Intention. </b> The reptilian brain appears to be the seat of telepathy, and for those inclined in that direction the seat of magic.
<p>
<b> Telepathy. </b> The writer may have got that wrong, allowing vexatious telepathy to swamp out all else.
<ul>
<li>
In the Dr Andrija Puharich scenario, a person tends to telepath when in fear of death or acute distress. Telepathy is received when a person is in a relaxed state of mind.
<li>
The writer's experience is that schizophrenics are always in a state of distress, as they have to defend their own private universes, and thus they are always telepathing their defence mechanisms. While schizophrenics are the main offenders, this can also apply to bipolars and other alleged disorders. When someone
gets a download, this download will also behave in a similar way.  As the writer can only remote view vexatious telepaths and downloads targeting either him or the people in general, this suits him.
<li>
Then there is Social Telepathy as described by Dr Rupert Sheldrake. On the one hand the writer has put this down to the stresses and strains of family life, but on the other hand he may be guilty of failing to acknowledge friendly telepathy he has picked up. However when a psychic is reading the Tarot or the tea leaves for someone, they are most likely picking up sub-conscious telepathy. You may know more about this sort of thing than he does.
<li>
The writer has no experience of physical telekinesis, so will not comment on it.
<li>
We all appear to have our own particular sectors within which we can work.
<li>
The great bulk of telepathy is subconscious by both the sender and the receiver, and thus does not register on the conscious brain.
<li>
Science is very left hand brain orientated. When it examines psi, intention, necessity, emotion and interest get ignored, and these are the things psi runs on. Intention may be hard to measure, but necessity should be easier.  Also it is hard to put a subject in fear of death and remain on the right side of the law; also such experiments could  accidentally turn lethal.
</ul>
<p>
<p>
<b> Quantum Physics. </b> We have is listed below the latest simple explanation. The lost dimensions are worth investigating as people have left a lot of junk on them, presumably sub-consciously. Conscious use of the lost dimensions appears illusive, but should not be impossible.
<ol>
<li> The universe was created by the big bang and originally had 10 dimensions plus time.
<li> 7 dimensions promptly collapsed or rolled up. Distance does not exist in these dimensions, thus light years can become millimetres.
<li> Matter can only exist in the first 3 dimensions and can not exist in a 4th.
<li> Gravity can cross all dimensions but other forces can not. Thus all dark matter exists in the 7 collapsed dimensions.
<li> The universe has 11 dimensions if one includes time. However there are now reports that string theory in the 10th dimension needs an eleventh dimension to understand it.
<li> Quantum physics has no explanation of what happened before the Big Bang, or what created it.
<li> Quantum physics can be observed and used, but even the experts admit it is near impossible to understand and do not recommend trying.</ol>
<p>
<b> Understanding Quantum Physics. </b> The experts say that one can never understand Quantum Physics, but must accept it as a whole, which makes it sound a bit like a religion. Their statement probably implies that Quantum Physics does not lend itself to verbal or pictorial understanding and thinking. It is hard to express on paper. This in turn means that it is most difficult to teach students knowledge which can be regurgitated in an exam paper. For examination purposes it not a good subject, and definitely unsuitable for the tick box knowledge loved by the Ministry of Education and politicians. It does however lend itself to mathematics, which implies mathematics are another form of thinking, separate from verbal and pictorial. Conceptual thinking is needed here where one tries to map systems. Conceptual thinking is good for writing computer programs where on has all the knowledge, but not quite so good on Quantum Physics where so much information is hidden.
<p>
<b> Types of human thinking. </b> This is a list known to the writer. Should we ever encounter ETs, they will no doubt introduce us to a new type.
<ul>
<li> Verbal. Thinking in words.
<li> Pictorial. Thinking in pictures.
<li> Conceptual where one is looking at how a system fits together.
<li> Mathematical where one expresses concepts as mathematical formulae.
<li> Emotional thinking which is unlikely to apply to Quantum Physics but is important in human psychology.
<li> Hierarchical thinking which is important to religion, true scientists, the Masons and those who believe themselves to be of class, rank and station. Add in Eridean ETs and all slave masters. Hierarchical thinking short cuts all other thinking as one has to think in the same way as whoever is at the top of the hierarchy, who plays God. This is also known as peer pressure. This is also the way that the sub-conscious imposes itself on the conscious mind, if allowed to.
</ul>
<p>
<b> Conscious v Sub-conscious. </b> We may not know consciously how to use the lost dimensions, but the sub-conscious does. This is not a matter of things we prefer not to remember as in psycho analysis, which are probably written on the higher parts of the brain. We are looking at the primitive sub-conscious. The higher regions of the brain, like the left and right hemispheres work very well in the conventional 3 dimensions plus time. The basic reptilian brain does not, but does access the Universal Sub-conscious in the lost dimensions, which gives rise to beliefs and disbeliefs in religion, astrology and magic, most of which is not logical to the higher brain. New agers are fond of telling people that they should integrate and use the right hand side of the brain. Perhaps if they integrated the left hand side of the brain into the right, there might be slightly less schizophrenia. The reptilian brain appears dominant over the higher regions, which it should be in times of extreme trouble, as it is the operating system to shut down and restart the higher spheres. However the reptilian brain should work in union with the higher parts in normal times, and should not be greater, higher in the hierarchy or control the higher parts. It is worth remembering that Freud was scared of the Id (sub-conscious) ever escaping, a theory behind the plot of the cult film &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; (1956). We have also noted that normal psychotherapy can be very good at cleaning up the conscious mind, but not the sub-conscious, thus giving the sub-conscious a free run. This may account for why cults go paranoid.
<p>
<b> Lost Dimensions and Pseudo Dimensions. </b> The Sub-conscious can use the lost dimensions, but can not control them. Thus there is little evidence of physical levitation. However there is the problem of UFOs violating our air space, to the annoyance of the military, and probably violating the holy laws of the great God Einstein, a problem which does not go away. All 3 theories below may be true, one just has to apportion percentages to each. We shall refer to the dimensions used by the sub-conscious as pseudo dimensions regardless of whether they are pseudo or not.
<ul>
<li> The sub-conscious may be using the lost dimensions directly. In this case, the dimensions are no longer active but in passive mode.
<li> The sub-conscious may be using natural extensions of the lost dimensions.
<li> Human and other ET thought has created a parallel universe in the image of the Quantum Physics universe.
</ul>
<p>
<b> Individual Dimensions. </b> A probable reason for us not being able to recognise the lost dimensions is that we take them for granted. They may be staring us straight in the face and just be too obvious for us to see. It is also a puzzle to the writer that mass and energy are not regarded as dimensions. Some potential dimensions we have found are listed below.
<ul>
<li> Memory. A dimension of memory is essential in a dynamic virtual universe, to enable that universe to know from one moment to the next what it supposed to be and behave. Such a dimension is necessary to enable water to know at what temperature it is supposed to boil. There are reports that new chemical compounds discovered take time to decide and stabilise their melting points. As a pseudo dimension, this makes a good place for the graves of the dead and dead Gods, and also Akasha and astrological zodiacs.
<li> Possibilities. This definitely did sort itself out shortly after the Big Bang. There are quite a number of measurements of constants which if a fraction different would have prevented the universe from forming. As a pseudo dimension, this is an area for God, schizophrenia, paranoia, psychosis and imagination. Perhaps this collection is a warning against playing God.
<li> Energy. This is still with us as electricity, magnetism, gravity, etc. As a pseudo dimension, it is represented psychic energy, psychological fire and medical epilepsy if blocked. This dimension tends to wipe out other pseudo dimensions. Allow for negative energies.
<li> Mass. This is a measure of inertness. As a pseudo dimension, it is interchangeable with energy.
<li> There are plenty of other possible pseudo dimensions. It is a matter of flexing the imagination and testing out possibilities to see if they can be made to work. If one can use them to produce abreaction, there must be some truth there.
