Ladies who think all this not their style, should get their boyfriends to do it for them. It is the duty of every man to protect his women folk.

<h3>Remote Influencing and Mind Control.</h3>
<ul>
<li> Remote Influencing and Mind Control are strictly for the pure in heart.
<li> Using this negatively causes great offence if found out, and has got plenty of people murdered, who protested their innocence.
<li> Using negativity for one's own agenda creates negative feedback from the targets, which drive the user downhill and towards the lunatic asylum.
<li> Positive remote psychotherapy is normally welcomed by honest men. If it is detected, targets generally sit back and enjoy, and ladies regard it as an act of love. If it is not detected, then the target puts any positive effects down to his own intelligence.
<li> Positive remote psychotherapy is generally unwelcome by villains who have their own agenda or profit by being stuck in the past.
<li> The forgiveness of sin works well when sin is left undefined. Similarly what is positive and what is negative is a matter of ethics and morality, and can not be defined here.
<li> No government, president, God or religion can turn the negative into the positive.
<li> Commanding foreign targets to forgive or destroy anything greater than one's country may be permissible. Anything in the Spirit of positive psychotherapy should also be permissible. “The ends justify the means” can be a very dangerous path, especially if one does not fully inspect both the means and the ends.
<li> A fundamental limitation of psychotherapy is that it is near impossible to change anyone who is paid to be the way they are. Thus it is near impossible to change the views of a foreign rogue politician on one's own, as any show of softness is liable to result in the death of the politician. Now it only takes one person to do a remote viewing job. To change the views of a rogue president probably needs one hundred people working together, and possibly more. This is also known as peer pressure.
<li> Remote Schizophrenia can raise its ugly head, if one does too much negative stuff. Remote Schizophrenia originates from the Source, whatever that may be, and can be viewed as a miasma or morphic field. It pre-dates organised religion, and forms the foundations of organised religion. Thus it is higher up the negative hierarchy than most apocalypses. However it is still a beingness, and falls victim to doing.
<li> The Source can turn into the Acquired Memory Syndrome, which may in turn become Acquired Astrological Memories. Acquired memories can be every bit as real as real memories.
<li> Please note that since the Apocalypse in 2012, which no one noticed, we are no longer in the hierarchical house of Pisces, but in the democratic house of Aquarius. People are already complaining about the Tyranny by the Majority. On a personal level, the effect of astrology depends on personal beliefs. However the larger the group, the more valid it becomes.
</ul>
<p>
<a name="astrology"></a>
<h3>Astrology.</h3>
<ul>
<li> Astrology appears to predate all known religions, and has its origins before recorded history.  Therefore there is no known original maintenance manual.
<li> All information given here is speculative, but that is no reason for not starting to investigate. Thus any information given here may be proved wrong at a later date.
<li> Its possible origins include Denisovans, Neanderthals, Druids and Sufis, as well as ETs and their star systems. There is also the mythical planet Nibiru, said by the Sumerians to be the home planet of Jehovah and the Elohim. Nibiru appears to be an astrological entity and not a physical one, and therefore any return near Earth is unlikely to destroy Earth, but will play havoc with all users of astrology. You do your own investigation as the source of astrology is probably a mixture of the above.
<li> Allow for astrological logic, superimposed on our own for the survival of astrology. Currently Man does not like emptiness and voids, which favours astrology as it needs you to accept an irritant, namely astrology.
<li> Zodiacs appear to be strings of goals, to many to handle individually, each of which has 6 states as mentioned in <a href="d02i.htm"> Section S02.. </a> and <a href="d03j.htm">Section S03.. </a>
<li> Allow for multiple astrologies.
<li> Zodiacs, astrological houses and astrologies may be in conflict with their peers, and just about everything else. They all jostle for power.
<li> Each astrological house can have its own schizophrenia, probably due to rubbish left by winners to control losers. Check the astrological birth houses of medical schizophrenics.
<li> Allow for Zodiac Warfare and Astrological Warfare, Astrological Peace Communist style, and the resting places on the planets of  dead astrologers. Also allow for things which no longer exist, like memories. Also everything can turn into an illusion.
<li> The great apocalypse of 2012, which no one noticed, was in the Universe of Thought, and not the physical universe. It was the change over from the hierarchical Pisces to the more democratic Aquarius or revolution or the tyranny by the majority depending on one's viewpoint. Piscean magic no longer works, hence the apocalypse for its users. As all mainstream religions are hierarchical, this puts their magic now in doubt. Cabalism now has similar problems.
<li> Allow for Creators and Destroyers. Now if we can create and destroy astrological entities, then we are doing so within a universe which is more basic than the astrological universe.
<li> Skeptics like asking the question, &quot;What does one think about when in No-thought&quot;. The answer is that one is either in observation mode or asleep.
<li> Remember that you are a living entity, and therefore greater than any dead astrology, even if astrology tells you otherwise. The might of astrology is an illusion.
</ul>
<p>
<a name="apocalypse"></a>
<h3>The Apocalypse of Astrology.</h3>
<ul>
<li> Like everything else, astrology has an apocalypse to prevent you unwinding it. It is an illusion, even if it claims to be the Big Bang itself.
<li> The origins of astrology remain obscure. At present, it looks like a naturally evolving system created by Original Sinners and Astrologists, created to keep the peasants in order. The big problem with systems like this, is that they eventually trap their creators into the system they created. Systems like astrology may the natural outcome consciousness and the understanding of consciousness. Astrology may be responsible for civilisation, but we hope not.
<li> Astrology with its predestination has advantages for a society with a limited genetic pool and a standard unchanging environment. We hope this is not a look into Man's future.
<li> However do we really want predestination and a planned life.
<li> Look at one's life goals, as they may be of astrological origin.
<li> Look on Google for the goals and objectives of the astrological houses and astrological planets. From the objectives one can divine the magical systems of each, like hierarchies, communication, democracy, logic, fascination, etc.
<li> Target the goals, objectives and magic of each house and planet, to crash through the apocalypse. These targets look anything but marvellous in the cold light of day, when illusion and delusion are stripped away.
<li> Apocalypses are liable to turn into engrams. Target Every Original Apocalypse / Engram / Sinner / Creator, etc. Give Destruction a free rein.
</ul>
<p>
<a name="law"></a>
<h3>The Apocalypses of the Law and Schizophrenia.</h3>
<ul>
<li> This is a political minefield as the Law and Psychosis are heavily intertwined.
<li> The penalty in the UK for Contempt of Court is 12 months in prison.
<li> Whereas the origins of many thing lie well into the past, the Law, social order and paranoid schizophrenia are maintained by people currently alive.
<li> The Law contains some general agreements like on which side of the road to  drive.
<li> The Law also contains expressions of the Paranoid Schizophrenia of the ruling classes, to keep the peasants in order.
<li> There are Obsessive Compulsive Law Makers, a major sin of the European Union.
<li> There are also those who wish to Punish the Guilty, and when they run out of the guilty, they invent criminal law to keep up the stock of the guilty to punish.
<li> Ignorance of the law is not an allowed excuse, but the average house does not have enough space to store copies of all legal statutes and instruments.
<li> In an ideal world, a copy of each new law and statute should be delivered to every household on the date of implementation.
<li> The fantasies and legends of religion are kept alive by people currently alive.
<li> There are also immigrants who claim more rights for their race and religion than the indigenous population, and then shout racism against everyone who objects.
<li> Then there are the Politically Correct who change the law to suit fashion faster than a lady's fashion house, and turn the pursuit of virtue into a psychosis.
<li> There are too many instances of legal injustice, often against people who trust the law, so be prepared to defend yourself against the law.
<li> Target everyone who bares malice towards you, regardless of who they are.     There was the law of the old Wild West, “Do unto others before they do unto you”.
<li> Look at everything afresh.
<li> Target all apocalypses, as they sit at the top of all hierarchies.
</ul>
<a name="apex"></a>
<p>
<h3> Apex Apocalypses.</h3>
<ul>
<li> All apex apocalypses are in current time, and not in historic or pre-historic times.
<li> Along with the apocalypses of the law and paranoid schizophrenia come the apocalypses of religion, sex, sin, original sin and politics, and any other one can think of.
<li> Apocalypses tend to turn into engrams, which may turn into thunderbolts. This puts a new dimension on to the Wars of the Gods.
<li> The Apocalypse of Beingness outranks the others.
<li> Beingness is an addictive drug. There is a delusion (not shared by Buddhists) that any beingness is better than no beingness, even if it is an engram or astrological entity.
<li> Beingness must be kept dynamic, and not allowed to become static.
<li> Love and the Forgiveness of Sin outrank just about everything else, provided they are given teeth and used with intelligence. Unfortunately the Christian Church has emasculated both in order for the Church to gain control over the people.
<li> Take a look at -
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Denisovan Astrological Engrams.
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Denisovan Beingness Engrams.
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Sins of the Denisovans. Were they the original slave masters?
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="r70.htm#denis70"> M01.31</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="r75.htm#denis75"> M01.36</a>
<li> The Forgiveness of Original Sin appears to be the best psychological remedy for schizophrenia. The Original Sinners are whoever set up your religion.
<li> Look also at Schizophrenic Technology from the source, Religious Technology in the present, and the Original Schizophrenic.
<li> Look also at Epileptic Technology, the alleged nemesis of schizophrenia, and just Sub-conscious Technology which being sub-conscious is hard to observe.
<li> Look???? at Natural, Reptilian Brain and Psychic Technologies, if you can.
</ul>
<a name="stech"></a>
<p>
<h3> Schizophrenic Technology and Psychotronics.</h3>
<ul>
<li> This section is somewhat speculative, due to our inability to think consciously in the unconscious mind.
<li> Our reference to Schizophrenic Technology refers to to that of the ancients, while Psychotronics are usually blamed on governments. However if one can understand one, one can probably understand the other
<li> As the unconscious is below the level of consciousness, seeing its contents is difficult but not impossible if one is prepared to look at it via all angles, and prepared to command the unconscious to do things. Viewing detail is impossible, but one can target Real Time Lunacies, like Astrological Lunacies such as Piscean and Aquarian Lunacies.
<li> The conscious logical mind has little control of the unconscious. However a good grip of the physical world is a great aid to reality in the physical world, and a great aid to the destruction of unconscious psychological machines past their use by date. If one lets the unconscious take over completely, the result can land one in the lunatic asylum.
<li> The origins of all political, religious and other control systems lie in the unconscious. It has created the world you live in in times past. It is currently maintained by schizophrenics untroubled by psychiatrists.
<li> Old systems in the unconscious mind may have originally been survival, even if they are now obsolete. This can be a window into the minds of less evolved animals. It is survival to be an alpha male or female.
<li> It is only possible to enter the level of Schizophrenic Technology when one has control over all active past schizophrenic technology creations like astrology and engrams.
<li> When looking into this, or rather trying to look into the unconscious, one should first look at one's own schizophrenic technology and work outwards.
<li> There is an apocalypse of schizophrenic technology, so there is probably an apocalypse of the unconscious mind.
</ul>
<p>
<b> For future reference - Speculation -</b>
<ul>
<li> The Forgiveness of Sin (unspecified), Understanding.
<li> Psychopomposity. (Forgiving the Dead their Sins, to allow them to move on.)
<li> The Apocalypses of Universes, Creation and Destruction.
<li> Pisceans, Aquarians, Astrological houses.
<li> Everything that exists or no longer exists, Alpha Existences. It is impossible to destroy anything useful in real time, as it will just be regenerated.
<li> Paranoias, Schizophrenias, lunacies and Insanities.
<li> The Apocalypse of Existence (cf Buddhist Non-existence).
<li> Alpha Reptilian Brains.
<li> There is a strong connection between Akashic Fire, Apocalypse, Epilepsy and the stuff which holds engrams and other rubbish together. Epilepsy only becomes medical when it is blocked.
</ul>
<p>
<b> Energy Flows - Speculation - </b>
<ul>
<li> All mental objects are liable to turn into energy flows, or reveal themselves as black masses.
<li> All flows tend to have positive and negative aspects.
<li> The Schizophrenic flow (Creation) and the Epileptic flow (Destruction, Apocalyptic) are the 2 which control psychology and most mental objects, especially when the flows become fossilised and static.
<li> Other flows may include Healing / Disease, Love / Hate, Dowsing and Geomagnetic, Psycho-therapeutic / Control, Telekinetic, Forgiveness / Justice, Religious (including Atheist and Skeptic). and Psychopompic flows. There are many others, only limited by one's imagination.
<li> Reptilian Brains > Sub-conscious minds > Psychological flows > Psychological solid rubbish.
<li> Reptilian Brain Warfare.
<li> Survival, but some obsolete survival mechanisms look mighty peculiar.
<li> Our current view of astrology (until we change it) is that a dying ancient race of ETs decided to leave a psychic model of their civilisation, culture and knowledge, for any future race to pick up and use. This was picked by early man, and adapted to our Solar System. It may look highly attractive, but in the cold light of morning looks more like a vicious control system rather than a fountain of enlightenment. Look out for the possibility of astrology being a vehicle for ET vampires. Each house appears to have its own gods, and systems of magic. We have just changed (2012) from the hierarchical house of Pisces to the more democratic house of Aquarius, which is currently causing a lot of political and religious instability. The priests of Pisces are trying to hang on to their power at all costs.
<li> The apocalypse of astrology (and anything else coming to view).
</ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li> Every apocalypse that dare defy us / does not dare defy us.
<li> The apocalypses of the Universal Sub-conscious and Schizophrenia, Universal Apocalypse.
<li> Every loyal reptilian brain, every loyal brain, every loyal telepath, Universal Telepathy.
<li> The Quantum Universe, unfortunately only viewable via the sub-conscious mind. See <a href="http://www.viking-z.org/r54.htm"> M01.16 - Quantum Physics and the Master Zodiac.</a>
<li> Everything tends to turn into memories of pain. Memories of pain are quite as real as any pain in real time. Acquired memories of pain are quite as painful as ones one has actually experienced.
<li> The Quantum Physics Universe (home to Dark Matter and Energy which make up over 80% of our universe), our adventures in the Quantum Universe, Quantum Entities, Quantum Memory, Quantum Pain and Quantum A*******s. Sorry no information available, but they can be experienced.
<li> Grandmasters of the Quantum Universe, Grandmasters of Schizophrenia, etc.
</ul>

Perhaps we should be talking about Remote Operations and not Remote Viewing.
