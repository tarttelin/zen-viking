<h3> M07. Tools used in Remote Psychotherapy and Psychic Self-Defence. </h3> 
</div>
THE AKASHIC ELEMENTS. The main tools used in the S series of sections on Remote Psychotherapy can be plotted against the Akashic Elements. If one wants to remote view agencies or ETs, then one must be on a level of enlightenment and responsibility equal or above that of the target. This section is for anyone wanting an overview of the tools used. The Akashic Elements disappear if one clears out the Concepts of Emotion. All Akashic Elements are within the Universe of Minds and a list follows.
<p>
The best advice seems to be that one should use sections S01 to S06 first. Then if the reader decides he can do better at creating procedures, then he should use the most Fire and Physical Universe orientated tools he can use. He might well be right, as the writer has had to go through the door first and has probably taken the long way around.
<p>
<b>NB.</b> One can not affect anything in the Physical Universe, a physical human body, a Spirit or produce psi with this type of meditation, which may be hard to believe. What one can do is remove all negative mental influences, black magic, mind control, etc, so that anything that can happen will happen.. We do not need minds. When the writer is called on to heal anyone, he commands that person to heal themselves, and if anything can happen it normally does.
<ul>
<li> OUTSIDE the Universe of Minds and in the Physical Universe of the Galaxy.
<ul>
<li> All tools used here are for location and work in the Physical Universe.
</ul>
<li> THE AKASHIC ELEMENTS can not exist in the Physical Universe. The main ones are:-
<ul>
<li> FIRE is the escape element or failing that the element which cleans and rejuvenates. This does include the Fires of Hell and Purgatory which should be treated as a hot bath to burn off all rubbish.
<li> AIR is the element of logic which tries to make sense out of emotion and minds and make them work. This is creating order out of chaos.
<li> WATER is the element of emotion where one is lost in mentalism and only the minds are real and the Physical Universe is an illusion. Take out Water and the whole of Akasha collapses.
<li> EARTH is the happy dumping ground for rubbish which one wants to hide away. 
</ul></ul>
TOOLS FOR REMOTE PSYCHOTHERAPY.
<ul>
<li> TOOLS FOR THE OUTSIDE WORLD.
<ul>
<li> LOCATION as in Location in Space, Time and Infinity where one is locating oneself in the real World. 
<li> CURING (Cure) of disease is the external version of healing which tends to be a Water emotion.
<li> PSI and it various forms work on occasions.
</ul>
<li> EARTH.
<ul>
<li> RESPONSIBILITY (Be responsible for / to) is the lowest emotion of Spirit which will clean up rubbish. Do not use this on friends and one's nearest and dearest, as it can loop back cleaning up the current level, and enforce responsibility at the next level up which may not be appreciated. Do not use on any form of psi or ability as these are outside the Akashic Elements. It will not work where the other Akashic Elements are active but will work very nicely on the entities which contain the Akashic Elements. It is highly suitable for cleaning up one's own mind, and for enemies, ETs (except the Reptoids and Erideans), Zodiacs, obsolete Gods, minds and psychological downloads. When used on outside entities one must also repair one's own responsibility to oneself as one goes along. The first victims of commanding outside entities to be responsible for their action are those entities which claim to be outside but are actually inside. Responsibility will work right up to the top, provided one goes for entities and not their contents. <b> All objections to responsibility disappear if one targets the owners of the target instead of the target, as this is going at least one level up.</b> 
</ul> 
<li> WATER. Most of these do not work as they loop one back into the emotions of Water. They sometimes have limited use for repair work. The below are all socially useful emotions but rarely work as psychotherapy tools.
<ul>
<li> LOVE is a bottom end emotion of Spirit and is the biggest trap of all time. Do not use.
<li> HEALING is also a bottom end emotion of Spirit. Curing (as of disease or psychosis) is the associated physical ability.
<li> FORGIVENESS (Forgive) must be of the type &quot;Forgive and forget&quot;, and is sometimes useful for dumping old targets when they are not worth the hassle.
<li> CREATION (Create) usually only works in conjuction with Destruction. Creation on its own will only loop one back into Water. Synthesis usually works better. Creation only works if Destruction is also implied. 
</ul>
<li> AIR is the element of trying to make sense of Akasha by means of logic.
<ul>
<li> SYNTHESIS (Synthesise) is the Air version of Creation and is good for sorting out ideas. It can however take on on a grand tour of the Akashic Elements.
<li> CHANGE and REORGANISATION (Reorganise) rearrange things to see if they fit better, and is detested by minds. 
<li> POSTULATION (Postulate) of abilities, etc, can be useful. It is better than Creation. 
<li> SWITCH-ON, SWITCH-OFF, LOAD, DE-LOAD, WATCH, SEE and CLEANSING (Cleanse) may be useful on occasions. 
</ul>
<li> FIRE is the great cleaner. It is the element for people who want to get things done, to escape the world of illusion and enter the Physical Universe properly. This is essential for remote viewing Reptoids and Erideans as they work at this level. It is also useful for burning the pants off enemies. Any Fire tool should be used in third party (ie on someone else) before using it in in the first party (I) as initially they can make one's hair stand on end.
<ul>
<li> TELEKINESIS (Telekine) means moving pieces of mind from A to B. Minds do not like this one little bit. Physical Telekinesis is its counterpart in the Physical World. 
<li> INCINERATION (Incinerate) burns off rubbish and obsolete entities.
<li> DESTRUCTION (Destroy) destroys rubbish and obsolete entities. There are plenty of mental mechanisms for creation but none for destruction, and thus all mental universes are thoroughly chocked up and need cleaning out. This is like cleaning out one's house and putting all rubbish in the dustbin. Destruction works well in conjuction with Creation to complete the cycle &quot;Create, Change, Destroy&quot;. 
<li> DISCONNECTION (Disconnect) is the fate of many minds. When people tire of a God or system, they go and seek new versions leaving the old to decay through lack of attention.
<li> CLEARING (Clear) means more in the USA than the UK. It means the removal of rubbish as in &quot;Clearing out a building&quot;.
<li> REINCARNATION (Reincarnate) is the fate all minds dread as the host is liable to lose the mind concerned.
