<b>Psychopomps</b> <i> are creatures, spirits, angels, or deities in many religions whose responsibility is to escort newly deceased souls from Earth to the afterlife. (Wiki).</i> In practice this means anyone who is prepared to talk to the recent dead without judgement,and thus help them through Purgatory and move on. This can be expanded. Thus our psychopomposity can be expanded to cover the forgiveness of sin / engrams / memes / astrology / apocalypses / social schizophrenia, in fact anything psychological regardless of what quantum universe it is in.
<p>
It can also be expanded to cover the living, the recent dead and the dead. In developing psychopomposity, one should start with oneself and work outwards. In practice, it is impossible to free of sin, because doing a good deed to one person diminishes the good to another. It is however theoretically possible to be in a constant state of forgiveness to anything which comes one's way. Psychopomposity is best seen as a human emotion in the relationship between parents and their children. It can be very selective.
<p>
<b> The Poltergeist </b> is a high energy form of being, and is the teeth of the psychopomp.
<p>
<b> Notes for investigation.</b>
<br> The Law of the Land is generally written. Psychological and religious law, ancient and modern, rarely is.
<br> The apocalypses of the Law, existences, the Source, sin, schizophrenia, pain, monotheist gods and memory.
<br> The pain of acquired engrams.
<br> Psychopomping all apocalypses. The Universal Psychopomp. Universal Telepathy.
<br> Is God (singular) a communion of psychopomps?
<br> The Apocalypses of Sin, Engrams, Telepathy, Nirvana, Opium, Social Schizophrenia, Psychological Existence, Universal Telepathy, Universal Energy and Consciousness. Schizophrenia may be the price of consciousness.
<p>
<b> Doingness and Work</b> cover the creation and destruction of beingness, sin and schizophrenia. Forgiveness of sin and the psychopomp appear as the highest form of beingness. Target all works. Can a psychopomp forgive the Machinery of the Universe / Establishment?
<a name="sky"></a>
<p>
<b> The Great Sky Engram.</b>
<br> Look at the concepts of both the Great Sky Psychopomp and the Great Sky Engram.
<br> The next stage up is pure energy.
<a name="plague"></a>
<p>
<b> The Imagination and Imaginary Energy. </b>
<br> Like the square root of Minus one in mathematics, imaginary energy can appear remarkably real. At the bottom end for practical purposes, is the Psychic Plague, which no one wants to meet twice. The Holy Ghost at the top for Christians. Other religions probably have their equivalents. In between we have Engram Energy, the Schizophrenic Plague, Akashic Energy and Healing energy, and probably the Toronto Blessing as well. The quality of energies depends on their emotional level. The list of variations is endless. These flows are raw energy, but without logic. It looks as though the priesthood supply the logic, to suit themselves and thus create Gods and theologies. This is real opium.
<p>
<b> The Attractions / Charisma of Schizophrenia. </b>
<br> What is so marvellous about it? The answer is that it is a supplier of Imaginary Energy or Akashic Energy, and as such is a honey trap. Imaginary Energy is the most sort after commodity in the Universe.
<p>
Active imaginations have created civilisations. While both remote viewers and schizophrenics have vivid imagination, the remote viewer finds it easy to return to the Physical Universe when he wants, while the schizophrenic prefers imaginary universes even if they trap him. What the remote viewer sees is an mental image picture showing the real world. There are even some people who believe the Physical Universe is an illusion, and that only the Spirit World is real.
<p>
Active imaginations have also created the illusions and delusions known as religion. These are systems in which no member can step back from, or escape. Therefore they can be classed a schizophrenias, even if they have been mutually agreed among the members.
<p>
When an imagination only has the agreement of one, then the one is either regarded as a silly fool, or in need of a psychiatrist and is deemed schizophrenic if he offends other people.
<p>
If we tend to target anything which threatens our serenity or that of our associates, we target malice and any other unfortunate emotion. Thus we have no incentive to remain outside the Physical Universe. Military Remote Viewers can get caught in a trap. Generals are only interested in how many guns the enemy has, and not in his emotions. However the emotions can be a contagious trap, if not handled.
<p>
<b> Imagination. </b>
<ul>
<li> Imagination builds civilisations if we use it properly, and are able to step back into the physical universe.
<li> Imaginary Energy is the opium politicians give to the people, and then people wonder why they have got the politicians they have.
<li> Imagination creates Imaginary Energy, the greatest opium going.
<li> We must be prepared to step back in the real world at all times.
<li> Imagination can turn sour, and the remedy is to step back into the real world.
<li> When imagination turns sour, and a person does not step back into the real world because he is an addict of imaginary energy, then he will be caught. This can result in medical, psychiatric and legal problems.
<li> Schizophrenics have the vice of un-controlled remote viewing. Thus his links may be real or unreal, and anyone remote viewing him may get either.
<li> How does one get the honey and not get stung?.
<li> The highest energy form a human can take is the Poltergeist.
</ul>
<p>
<b> Absolute Power Corrupts Absolutely.</b> True, if one is not prepared to step back into the physical universe. If not, one tends to believe one's own propaganda. This another source of opium like energy.
<p>
<b> Systems.</b>Most people prefer to live within the rules of a system, in return for the benefits of that system. If one can step outside or leave the system, it is an imagination. If one is not allowed to leave, then the system is a schizophrenia. However if one can not leave, how can one use it in the physical universe?
<a name="duality"></a>
<p>
<b> Dualities and the Creation of Energy.</b>
<br> It appears that imaginary energy or psychic energy is created between two opposites. Thus to have energy, one must have 2 things in opposition. A lot depends on personal preferences and definitions. We do not need dualities in order to live. However the energy from these dualities has produced some mighty creations. Examples of dualities include -
<ul>
<li> Good versus evil. The priesthood are very good at defining this one. However to everyone else, one man's good is another man's evil, and visa versa.
<li> Science versus the paranormal.
<li> Survival versus non-survival.
<li> Love versus hate.
<li> Like versus dislike.
<li> Race versus Race, God versus God, and Religious cult versus Religious Cult are a complete pain in the neck.
<li> Left hand higher brain versus right hand higher brain. This tends to include verbal versus pictorial thinking.
<li> The higher brain versus the reptilian brain. Consciousness versus the sub-conscious.
<li> The ultimate duality is probably genetic, and written in our DNA, probably variations of Master versus Servant. If this is true, then probably a little is survival, but having a lot is non-survival.
</ul>
<a name="gaia"></a>
<p>
<b> The history of the universe. </b>
<ul>
<li> What happened before the Big Bang is not known, but it was probably the collapse of the previous universe.
<li> The Big Bang.
<li> The Big bang created 3 dimensions plus time, being the universe known to Science. It also created 7 dimensions alleged by Quantum Physics to have disappeared as soon as the universe was created.
<li> A memory of the Big Bang lives on in one the so called lost dimensions, and is accessible to the primitive Reptilian Brain, but not the higher Conscious Brain.
<li> This memory lives on, and has been added to by Man, and has been fed with energy.
<li> This memory becomes the Master Or Vampire Engram, or Great Sky Engram, feeding on our energy.
<li> Some of this energy is returned to those who look after it, in the form of the Holy Ghost or similar.
<li> Most of this energy is used to protect the Great Sky Engram, in the form of the Psychic Plague or some similar form, against anyone who tries to dismantle it.
<li> Most of the Psychic Plague is condensed into Gods, religion and Akasha.
<li> We as humans live within this lost dimension or dimensions, and have our own psychology governed by our DNA and experience.
<li> Thus we live in 2 separate systems, one governed by the results of the Big Bang, with the other governed by human psychology and our experience in life. The 2 interact.
<li> Thus Gaia, the World Goddess, becomes the personification of one or more of the lost dimensions of Quantum Physics and its contents.
</ul>
<p>
<b> The kingdom of Gaia, as viewed by Gaia.</b>
<ul>
<li> As no 2 people think exactly the same, we do not expect agreement.
<li> Gaia, the World Goddess or Earth Mother, becomes the personification of one or more of the lost dimensions of Quantum Physics and its contents.
<li> Gaia the Goddess.
<li> Raw Energy.
<li> Chaos. The World as we observe it.
<li> Man who can live with Chaos.
<li> Individual Chaoses.
<li> Man interacts with Gaia to produce Akashic energy. This energy can be expressed as Constructive Energy when it is capable of constructing Gods, Astrology and religion. It can be charismatic Energy. It becomes Schizophrenic Energy when uncontrolled, and the Psychic Plague when it runs amok or is used to protect Akashic constructions.
<li> Man who needs a God to create order out of Chaos.
<li> Thus man creates Gods out of Mother Gaia, to restrict his universe until it become orderly.
<li> These Gods created by man are the sons of Gaia, sired by Man.
<li> Such Gods must be given defences (energy), so that they are not unravelled to restore some Chaos or other.
<li> The Astrological Houses become the personification of the Daughters of Gaia, sired by Man.
<li> Forgiveness still works to disperse sin, theologies, astrology and schizophrenia. The Psychopomp is needed more than ever.
<li> Do not forget the sins of one's own ego.
<li> Akasha equals schizophrenias shared and agreed between people.
<li> Abreaction and the Toronto Blessing may be better than Forgiveness.
<li> Sin becomes anything which can not be changed to suit modern morality and requirements. Beware of retrospective morality.
</ul>
<a name="Nirvana"></a>
<p>
<b>Nirvana.</b>
<ul>
<li><i>(In Buddhism) A transcendent state in which there is neither suffering, desire, nor sense of self, and the subject is released from the effects of karma and the cycle of death and rebirth. It represents the final goal of Buddhism. - Wiki. </i>
<li> Nirvana is a state of zero and no rubbish, to allow one to return to Gaia.
<li> The Spirit World including Purgatory, Heaven, Hell and Paradise, lies between the living and Nirvana. The Spirit World is where one sheds all unwanted memories in order to proceed. What people call their section of the Spirit World is a reflecting of whether people want to hold on to their rubbish and their schizophrenic fantasies, or otherwise.
<li> One can enter the Spirit World to act as a psychopomp, and help in &quot;soul rescue&quot;.
</ul>
<a name="meme"></a>
<p>
<b> Denisovan Memes and other Ancient Memes. </b>
<ul>
<li> A definition of a <a href="r11i.htm">meme</a>.
<li> The Denisovans were an extinct race of giant Neanderthals, officially discovered in 2010 in Siberia. They were probably the Elohim, Nefilim, Annunaki, Lemurians and the Atlantians. They appear to have had superior psychic powers to ourselves. Thus if one is sufficiently versed in mind control, one can make the observer believe anything. One can make a cave look like a palace, and one can also appear to be the height of wisdom.
<li> The meme is the basic building block of all engrams, fighting zodiacs, psychic warfare, astrology, and schizophrenic technology.
<li> Schizophrenic technology is useful in the construction of Gods and religions.
<li> We have inherited Denisovan memes in vampire fashion. It does help them if we invite them in.
<li> Psychological reality is constantly changing. Thus yesterday's reality becomes today's sin. What was acceptable in the past is no longer acceptable, and visa versa.
<li> If the change in psychological reality is too severe, this can lead to schizophrenic memes stuck in the past.
<li> Schizophrenia may be a mixture of social and medical schizophrenia. However some schizophrenic memes can be traced back to the Denisovans.
<li> Schizophrenia appears to be uncontrolled imagination. Thus controlled schizophrenia may well be a vivid imagination. This may be a cue for <a href="d01i.htm"> Conscious walking </a> as a remedy for schizophrenic minds.
<li> &quot;I am creative, you have a vivid imagination, but he is schizophrenic. &quot;
<li> The Denisovans are now extinct, except possibly for Bigfoot and the Abominable Snowman. We probably killed them off, as we could not stand their mind control. Alternatively they were killed off by their own schizophrenic technology. Alternatively our psychic abilities are better than we think.
<li> The researcher, Andrew Collins, is far more charitably disposed to the Denisovans, and credits them with kick starting civilisation.
<li> The Apocalypse of (psychological) Reality.
<li> The Apocalypses of the Sub-Conscious Mind and Reptilian Brain.
<li> The Apocalypses of Schizophrenia and Telepathy.
</ul>
<p>
<b> Thought Constructions.</b>
<ul>
<li> We construct memes and other thought machines all the time, as short cuts to thinking. There are no problems, provided we are prepared to destroy them after their use by date. If they get stuck in a time warp, then they use us, instead of us using them.
<li> The Machinery of the Universe, the Machinery of the Law, Cult Machines.
<li> Schizophrenic Engineering, Schizophrenics.
<li> Remote Psychotherapy undoes machinery past its use by date. Thus cults hate remote psychotherapy.
<li> Not all schizophrenics are locked up. Some are in high places, and you have probably voted for them.
<li> NWO and the Illuminati, real or imagined.
</ul>
<p>
<b> Universal Conscious Telepathy.</b>
<ul>
<li> People telepath sub-consciously when in distress, have an overload, or do not wish to be found out.
<li> We have no information on how to telepath messages consciously.
<li> Thus Universal Conscious telepathy is really concerned with Conscious Reception.
<li> Religions, cults, theologies, engrams, memes, astrologies, schizophrenias and mental machines hate the idea of conscious reception, as it dismantles them. Therefore they will put everything in the way to make you do not do it. If one consciously receives messages from then, one can engage them in dialogue, which leads to them dismantling themselves. Otherwise one can just forgive them their sins, if that is more appropriate.
<li> Telepathy is supposed to be received sub-consciously in order to brainwash you.
<li> This a bit akin to soul rescue work.
<li> Plenty of things exist, as they have never been asked why they exist or what they are doing.
<li> Telepathy outwards becomes just another sin.
</ul>
<p>
<b> You too can be as the Gods (if you are not careful).</b>
<ul>
<li> Telepathy and Godship become one and the same.
<li> Target all telepaths and Gods who are greater than oneself.
<li> We are now in the matrix oriented Aquarius, rather than the hierarchical Pisces. Thus all men are equals, alive or dead, and no one is greater than anyone else, unless they have earned the right.
<li> The Apocalypse of Telepathy, or rather the Apocalypse of the laws and rules of Telepathy.
<li> Conscious Telepathy, but unfortunately consciousness is ruled by the higher brain, while telepathy is ruled by the reptilian sub-conscious brain.
<li> Thus Positive Conscious Telepathy tends to be a weak force, but it does allow to be more proactive and less defensive.
<li> Mutual Telepathy, Mutual Energy and Mutual Universes have a lot in common.
<li> Everything not in the Physical Universe tends to move towards Zero, as we get rid of old rubbish.
<li> One is unlikely to find an Apocalypse of the Physical Universe, as it is the primary universe. All other universes are secondary, and so are their creations, and thus there are plenty of apocalypses of these secondary universes.
</ul>
<p>
<b> The Gift. </b>
<ul>
<li> Details of the Gift are too politically incorrect to publish.
<li> The Apocalypse of the Gift.
<li> Every original XXX.
<li> Dualities.
<Li> Allow for Universal Telepathy, Universal Magick (life without memes), Universal Universes, Communication between Universes, etc.
<li> Fire breathing dragons are good for clearing up rubbish. The dragon within.
<li> Fire versus Emotion.
</ul>
<a name="sre"></a>
<p>
<b> The Self Replicating Engrams or Engreme.</b>
<ul>
<li> The concept of Self Replicating Engrams explains many things.
<li> Dawkins postulated the Meme in 1976 as a self replicating unit of thought. It has since passed into the English language.
<li> The Engrams was first used to describe the effects of laboratory inflicted injuries to frog's eggs, around 1880. The current dictionary definition is any traumatic incident buried in the sub-conscious.
<li> The Self Replicating Engram can be defined as any self replicating unit of thought in the sub-conscious. It can describe sub-conscious thought unexplainable and unwanted by the conscious higher brain.
<li> Human thought is limited by the constraints of the conscious higher brain.
<li> Target all Self Replicating Engrams which claim they can not be returned to sender.
<li> We shall label the Self Replicating Engram as an Engreme, having the front end representing an Engraving or Engram, and a tail to show its affinity to the Meme.
<li> We find that statistically the most likely source are the Eridean ETs. They are alleged to be reptilian, black, smell awful and breath archetypal fire. They are the prototype for our Satan. See <a href="r12i.htm"> ETs and their activities - 2000..</a> However your opinion is a good as anyone else's, as sources have a habit of disappearing to be replaced by others.
<li> Incidents relating to the body creating engrams are unlikely to be self replicating.
<li> The Engreme may the key to schizophrenia, and purging them may be a remedy. However it is the responsibility of the victim to prevent any return, as he probably has a weakness in that department.
<li> Spiritual Healing may be the purging of engremes and engrams which affect health.
<li> Back around 1970, a group of dowsers decided to investigate how dowsing work, by dowsing. However every time they looked like getting an answer, reality changed which sent them back to the drawing board. In a similar way, it appears every theology is out of date the moment it is published.
</ul>
<b> Natural Ability versus Akasha.</b>
<ul>
<li> The whole of the Universe of Thought appears to be made up of the Akashic elements, Earth, Air, Fire and Water.
<li> Akasha includes Imaginations, the Machinery of the Universe, Engremes, Astrology, Religions and Apocalypses.
<li> Natural Ability includes Remote Viewing, Remote Psychotherapy, Telepathy, Healing and Dowsing.
<li> Natural Ability is always greater than Akasha, regardless of what Akasha may tell you.
<li> The Telekinetic Apocalypse. Fossilised telekinesis protects remaining Akasha.
</ul>
<a name="emotion"></a>
<p>
<b>A Revised Scale of Emotions of the Sub-conscious or Reptilian Brain.</b>
<ul>
<li> Top. Repair and speculation. The Conscious and Sub-conscious brains working together.
<ul>
<li> Nirvana. (As in Buddhism when disputes between free wills are resolved. Total Freedom.)
<li> The Wars between Rival Free Wills.
<li> Free Will.
<li> Any conscious or observable psychic ability. This tends to dissolve the bottom.
<li> Courage. (As in Viking.)
<li> Forgiveness. (As in Christianity, but it is too high for most people, but even higher is the forgiveness of engrams, apocalypses and Akasha.)
<li> Love and Friendship. (Asexual.)
</ul>
<li> Middle. Normality. The Sub-conscious or Living God looking after the body.
<ul>
<li> Imagination, the destruction (Akashic Fire) of obsolete psychological entities.
<li> Imagination, the creation (Akashic Air) of psychological entities and universes. Also Civilisation, Lucifer and the quest for Enlightenment. This also involves trying to explain the unexplainable.
<li> Living, survival, procreation, pleasure and the avoidance of pain.
<li> Failure, Death.
</ul>
<li> Bottom. Fossilised existence. Akashic Gods. This a dumping ground for creations past their sell by date, and have not been uncreated. Anything to survive here must be attractive, otherwise people will purge it. Thus the occult and religion are very attractive, but lead into a downward spiral. It is also the seat of telepathy to signal distress for survival purposes, or as mind control over other people.
<ul>
<li> Here is the start of Psychological Existence and Fossilised Beingness.
<li> Mind Control of other people. This is notoriously negative, and tends to put one in a downward spiral. The seat of religion.
<li> Seek a Winning Identity or winning possession (The Akashic element of Water, or emotion). For a monotheist this may be God, and for polytheists and others can be various archetypes and archetypal gods. This is usually projected outside the individual, and can form group entities like monotheist gods, or personal alter-egos. Anyone claiming to be God is thus viewed with suspicion, as this tends to give the game away. There are other forms of the winning identity, and the views of Freud are still valid. This also looks like the seat of schizophrenia, so the winning identity can take many forms. (A good remedy is the Divinity of Man.)
<li> The Law to hold the winning identity in place. Expect telekinesis, Satan and other apocalypses. (Fight fire with Fire. If one removes the appropriate law or theology, one can give up the identity.)
<li> Regret, Blame, Shame, Guilt and Original Sin at not living up to the ideals of the winning identity.
<li> Giving up to be Punishing the Guilty, the Controller, Owner, Slave or just a cabbage or a******e.
<li> The Cloaca (Roman goddess of sewers). Dumping ground for all black mass, including engrams and Akashic Earth.
</ul>
<li> Thus target all reptilian brain or sub-conscious emotions, especially those in distress.
<li> All emotions are present, but some are active, and some are dormant. One can target the emotion which one considers most desirable, even if it is dormant, and wake it up.
<li> The urge is to return to a point of balance or normality. This may involve finding new abilities and making them normal.
<li> In theory the sub-conscious mind which prefers to be called the Soul or Living God, will do a lot of work for one, while one is asleep and interpreted by conscious minds. Train the Soul to work for one while asleep.
<li> Purge all Akashic Gods which claim to be greater than Living Gods, or step out of line.
<li> Check for Gods of Creation, Change, No-Change, and Destruction. If we need Gods, we need them all.
<li> The bottom line is that people have brains, brains create thoughts and thoughts create memories.
</ul>
<p>
<div align=center><b>A Table of Telepathy and Psi.</b></div>
<ul>
<li> Positive.
<ul>
<li> Telepathic Nirvana.
<li> The Wars of Rival Free Telepathic Wills.
<li> Free Telepathic Will.
<li> Telepathic Intention.
<li> Telepathic Clearing. (Of Akasha and Karma.)
<li> Telepathic Healing. (The healing of mental disorders, but not any medical component. )
<li> Telepathic Forgiveness. (The Forgiveness of Sin, Engrams, Astrology, etc,)
<li> Remote Psychotherapy.
<li> Mind Reading.
<li> Psychic Reading.
<li> Dowsing.
<li> Remote Viewing.
<li> Abreaction, Humour.
<li> Destruction of Creations past their use by date.
</ul>
<li>
<li> The Baseline, the Brain.
<li>
<li> Negative.
<ul>
<li> Imagination and Creation.
<li> Religion.
<li> Black Magic, Psychic Warfare, Psychotronics and Downloads.
<li> Mental Illness. (Includes PTSD and Schizophrenia, but not any medical component.)
<li> Karma and Akasha.
</ul></ul>
Now such a scale will be multi-dimensional according to the point of view of the viewer. The positive when it is used, is liable to burn up the negative, and return one to the current baseline. Also nothing is mutually exclusive. All levels are present, but some will need waking up.
<p>
<div align=center><b>The Brain from the point of view of the brain.</b></div>
<ul>
<li> Consider the pain barriers of the brain.
<li> Minds should be dynamic and serve the brain.
<li> Target static minds which are greater than the brain.
<li> The brain should control all minds and not vice versa.
<li> The Apocalypse off the brain. (Working through all Fire and Pain Barriers.)
<li> The Forgiveness of all Engrams, Memes, Zodiacs, Astrologies, etc, greater than the brain.
<li> The Forgiveness of all Schizophrenias, Paranoias, other Psychosis, etc, greater than the Brain.
<li> The Forgiveness of the Occult, or rather Yesterday's Occult.
<li> The forgiveness of all Minds that are greater than a Brain.
<li> All this can be very painful, so it is only for the brave.
<li> Virtue is easy if it is never tested.
<li>
<li> The Apocalypse of the Human Body.
</ul>
<p>
<div align=center><b>The Magician.</b></div>
<p>
<ul>
<li> The Magician is the dynamic opposite to the static God, in the Reptilian Brain or Sub-conscious mind.
<li> The Magician is creative and can be a bit too creative if it is not kept in check by the Physical Universe and the Higher Conscious Mind.
<li> The Magician can create Schizophrenic and other universes if it is uncontrolled.
<li> The Magician has access to areas of Quantum Physics not viewable by the conscious mind.
<li> Areas worth investigating include the creation of Telepathy and other abilities under conscious control.     Also one can look at hierarchies of Magicians.
<li> The old style magician depends on being able to manipulate the souls of the dead, who are there to manipulate because no one has forgiven them their sins and they have unfinished business.
<li> The new depends on his own senses and abilities, and the use of thought breakers like random 8 digit numbers and Tarot cards.
<li> Play the Piscean, Aquarian and astrological magicians off against each other.
<li> Command all astrological and other similar entities to forgive every one who has found them out or betrayed them.
<li> The Apocalypse of Pain / Quantum Physics.
<li> Everything that no longer exists / never existed.
</ul>
