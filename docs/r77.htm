<b>Psychopomps</b> <i> are creatures, spirits, angels, or deities in many religions whose responsibility is to escort newly deceased souls from Earth to the afterlife. (Wiki).</i> In practice this means anyone who is prepared to talk to the recent dead without judgement,and thus help them through Purgatory and move on. This can be expanded. Thus our psychopomposity can be expanded to cover the forgiveness of sin / engrams / memes / astrology / apocalypses / social schizophrenia, in fact anything psychological regardless of what quantum universe it is in.
<p>
It can also be expanded to cover the living, the recent dead and the dead. In developing psychopomposity, one should start with oneself and work outwards. In practice, it is impossible to free of sin, because doing a good deed to one person diminishes the good to another. It is however theoretically possible to be in a constant state of forgiveness to anything which comes one's way. Psychopomposity is best seen as a human emotion in the relationship between parents and their children. It can be very selective.
<p>
<b> The Poltergeist </b> is a high energy form of being, and is the teeth of the psychopomp.
<p>
<b> Notes for investigation.</b>
<br> The Law of the Land is generally written. Psychological and religious law, ancient and modern, rarely is.
<br> The apocalypses of the Law, existences, the Source, sin, schizophrenia, pain, monotheist gods and memory.
<br> The pain of acquired engrams.
<br> Psychopomping all apocalypses. The Universal Psychopomp. Universal Telepathy.
<br> Is God (singular) a communion of psychopomps?
<br> The Apocalypses of Sin, Engrams, Telepathy, Nirvana, Opium, Social Schizophrenia, Psychological Existence, Universal Telepathy, Universal Energy and Consciousness. Schizophrenia may be the price of consciousness.
<p>
<b> Doingness and Work</b> cover the creation and destruction of beingness, sin and schizophrenia. Forgiveness of sin and the psychopomp appear as the highest form of beingness. Target all works. Can a psychopomp forgive the Machinery of the Universe / Establishment?
<a name="sky"></a>
<p>
<b> The Great Sky Engram.</b>
<br> Look at the concepts of both the Great Sky Psychopomp and the Great Sky Engram.
<br> The next stage up is pure energy.
<a name="plague"></a>
<p>
<b> The Imagination and Imaginary Energy. </b>
<br> Like the square root of Minus one in mathematics, imaginary energy can appear remarkably real. At the bottom end for practical purposes, is the Psychic Plague, which no one wants to meet twice. The Holy Ghost at the top for Christians. Other religions probably have their equivalents. In between we have Engram Energy, the Schizophrenic Plague, Akashic Energy and Healing energy, and probably the Toronto Blessing as well. The quality of energies depends on their emotional level. The list of variations is endless. These flows are raw energy, but without logic. It looks as though the priesthood supply the logic, to suit themselves and thus create Gods and theologies. This is real opium.
<p>
<b> The Attractions / Charisma of Schizophrenia. </b>
<br> What is so marvellous about it? The answer is that it is a supplier of Imaginary Energy or Akashic Energy, and as such is a honey trap. Imaginary Energy is the most sort after commodity in the Universe.
<p>
Active imaginations have created civilisations. While both remote viewers and schizophrenics have vivid imagination, the remote viewer finds it easy to return to the Physical Universe when he wants, while the schizophrenic prefers imaginary universes even if they trap him. What the remote viewer sees is an mental image picture showing the real world. There are even some people who believe the Physical Universe is an illusion, and that only the Spirit World is real.
<p>
Active imaginations have also created the illusions and delusions known as religion. These are systems in which no member can step back from, or escape. Therefore they can be classed a schizophrenias, even if they have been mutually agreed among the members.
<p>
When an imagination only has the agreement of one, then the one is either regarded as a silly fool, or in need of a psychiatrist and is deemed schizophrenic if he offends other people.
<p>
If we tend to target anything which threatens our serenity or that of our associates, we target malice and any other unfortunate emotion. Thus we have no incentive to remain outside the Physical Universe. Military Remote Viewers can get caught in a trap. Generals are only interested in how many guns the enemy has, and not in his emotions. However the emotions can be a contagious trap, if not handled.
<p>
<b> Imagination. </b>
<ul>
<li> Imagination builds civilisations if we use it properly, and are able to step back into the physical universe.
<li> Imaginary Energy is the opium politicians give to the people, and then people wonder why they have got the politicians they have.
<li> Imagination creates Imaginary Energy, the greatest opium going.
<li> We must be prepared to step back in the real world at all times.
<li> Imagination can turn sour, and the remedy is to step back into the real world.
<li> When imagination turns sour, and a person does not step back into the real world because he is an addict of imaginary energy, then he will be caught. This can result in medical, psychiatric and legal problems.
<li> Schizophrenics have the vice of un-controlled remote viewing. Thus his links may be real or unreal, and anyone remote viewing him may get either.
<li> How does one get the honey and not get stung?.
<li> The highest energy form a human can take is the Poltergeist.
</ul>
<p>
<b> Absolute Power Corrupts Absolutely.</b> True, if one is not prepared to step back into the physical universe. If not, one tends to believe one's own propaganda. This another source of opium like energy.
<p>
<b> Systems.</b>Most people prefer to live within the rules of a system, in return for the benefits of that system. If one can step outside or leave the system, it is an imagination. If one is not allowed to leave, then the system is a schizophrenia. However if one can not leave, how can one use it in the physical universe?
<a name="duality"></a>
<p>
<b> Dualities and the Creation of Energy.</b>
<br> It appears that imaginary energy or psychic energy is created between two opposites. Thus to have energy, one must have 2 things in opposition. A lot depends on personal preferences and definitions. We do not need dualities in order to live. However the energy from these dualities has produced some mighty creations. Examples of dualities include -
<ul>
<li> Good versus evil. The priesthood are very good at defining this one. However to everyone else, one man's good is another man's evil, and visa versa.
<li> Science versus the paranormal.
<li> Survival versus non-survival.
<li> Love versus hate.
<li> Like versus dislike.
<li> Race versus Race, God versus God, and Religious cult versus Religious Cult are a complete pain in the neck.
<li> Left hand higher brain versus right hand higher brain. This tends to include verbal versus pictorial thinking.
<li> The higher brain versus the reptilian brain. Consciousness versus the sub-conscious.
<li> The ultimate duality is probably genetic, and written in our DNA, probably variations of Master versus Servant. If this is true, then probably a little is survival, but having a lot is non-survival.
</ul>
<a name="gaia"></a>
<p>
<b> The history of the universe. </b>
<ul>
<li> What happened before the Big Bang is not known, but it was probably the collapse of the previous universe.
<li> The Big Bang.
<li> The Big bang created 3 dimensions plus time, being the universe known to Science. It also created 7 dimensions alleged by Quantum Physics to have disappeared as soon as the universe was created.
<li> A memory of the Big Bang lives on in one the so called lost dimensions, and is accessible to the primitive Reptilian Brain, but not the higher Conscious Brain.
<li> This memory lives on, and has been added to by Man, and has been fed with energy.
<li> This memory becomes the Master Or Vampire Engram, or Great Sky Engram, feeding on our energy.
<li> Some of this energy is returned to those who look after it, in the form of the Holy Ghost or similar.
<li> Most of this energy is used to protect the Great Sky Engram, in the form of the Psychic Plague or some similar form, against anyone who tries to dismantle it.
<li> Most of the Psychic Plague is condensed into Gods, religion and Akasha.
<li> We as humans live within this lost dimension or dimensions, and have our own psychology governed by our DNA and experience.
<li> Thus we live in 2 separate systems, one governed by the results of the Big Bang, with the other governed by human psychology and our experience in life. The 2 interact.
<li> Thus Gaia, the World Goddess, becomes the personification of one or more of the lost dimensions of Quantum Physics and its contents.
</ul>
<p>
<b> The kingdom of Gaia, as viewed by Gaia.</b>
<ul>
<li> As no 2 people think exactly the same, we do not expect agreement.
<li> Gaia, the World Goddess or Earth Mother, becomes the personification of one or more of the lost dimensions of Quantum Physics and its contents.
<li> Gaia the Goddess.
<li> Raw Energy.
<li> Chaos. The World as we observe it.
<li> Man who can live with Chaos.
<li> Individual Chaoses.
<li> Man interacts with Gaia to produce Akashic energy. This energy can be expressed as Constructive Energy when it is capable of constructing Gods, Astrology and religion. It can be charismatic Energy. It becomes Schizophrenic Energy when uncontrolled, and the Psychic Plague when it runs amok or is used to protect Akashic constructions.
<li> Man who needs a God to create order out of Chaos.
<li> Thus man creates Gods out of Mother Gaia, to restrict his universe until it become orderly.
<li> These Gods created by man are the sons of Gaia, sired by Man.
<li> Such Gods must be given defences (energy), so that they are not unravelled to restore some Chaos or other.
<li> The Astrological Houses become the personification of the Daughters of Gaia, sired by Man.
<li> Forgiveness still works to disperse sin, theologies, astrology and schizophrenia. The Psychopomp is needed more than ever.
<li> Do not forget the sins of one's own ego.
<li> Akasha equals schizophrenias shared and agreed between people.
<li> Abreaction and the Toronto Blessing may be better than Forgiveness.
<li> Sin becomes anything which can not be changed to suit modern morality and requirements. Beware of retrospective morality.
</ul>
<a name="Nirvana"></a>
<p>
<b>Nirvana.</b>
<ul>
<li><i>(In Buddhism) A transcendent state in which there is neither suffering, desire, nor sense of self, and the subject is released from the effects of karma and the cycle of death and rebirth. It represents the final goal of Buddhism. - Wiki. </i>
<li> Nirvana is a state of zero and no rubbish, to allow one to return to Gaia.
<li> The Spirit World including Purgatory, Heaven, Hell and Paradise, lies between the living and Nirvana. The Spirit World is where one sheds all unwanted memories in order to proceed. What people call their section of the Spirit World is a reflecting of whether people want to hold on to their rubbish and their schizophrenic fantasies, or otherwise.
<li> One can enter the Spirit World to act as a psychopomp, and help in &quot;soul rescue&quot;.
</ul>
<a name="meme"></a>
<p>
<b> Denisovan Memes and other Ancient Memes. </b>
<ul>
<li> A definition of a <a href="r11i.htm">meme</a>.
<li> The Denisovans were an extinct race of giant Neanderthals, officially discovered in 2010 in Siberia. They were probably the Elohim, Nefilim, Annunaki, Lemurians and the Atlantians. They appear to have had superior psychic powers to ourselves. Thus if one is sufficiently versed in mind control, one can make the observer believe anything. One can make a cave look like a palace, and one can also appear to be the height of wisdom.
<li> The meme is the basic building block of all engrams, fighting zodiacs, psychic warfare, astrology, and schizophrenic technology.
<li> Schizophrenic technology is useful in the construction of Gods and religions.
<li> We have inherited Denisovan memes in vampire fashion. It does help them if we invite them in.
<li> Psychological reality is constantly changing. Thus yesterday's reality becomes today's sin. What was acceptable in the past is no longer acceptable, and visa versa.
<li> If the change in psychological reality is too severe, this can lead to schizophrenic memes stuck in the past.
<li> Schizophrenia may be a mixture of social and medical schizophrenia. However some schizophrenic memes can be traced back to the Denisovans.
<li> Schizophrenia appears to be uncontrolled imagination. Thus controlled schizophrenia may well be a vivid imagination. This may be a cue for <a href="d01i.htm"> Conscious walking </a> as a remedy for schizophrenic minds.
<li> &quot;I am creative, you have a vivid imagination, but he is schizophrenic. &quot;
<li> The Denisovans are now extinct, except possibly for Bigfoot and the Abominable Snowman. We probably killed them off, as we could not stand their mind control. Alternatively they were killed off by their own schizophrenic technology. Alternatively our psychic abilities are better than we think.
<li> The researcher, Andrew Collins, is far more charitably disposed to the Denisovans, and credits them with kick starting civilisation.
<li> The Apocalypse of (psychological) Reality.
<li> The Apocalypses of the Sub-Conscious Mind and Reptilian Brain.
<li> The Apocalypses of Schizophrenia and Telepathy.
