<b> Akasha and the Four elements</b>
</div>
<ul>
<li> Akasha is the sum total of yesterday's rubbish in the Universe of Thought. It contains old castles in the sky, and mental creations past their use by date which no one has bothered to destroy. Akasha is designed to send one on an interesting tour, but one will finish where one started.
<li> Cycles of Creation are essentially cycles of Create, Amend, Destroy. Everything created must eventually be destroyed, otherwise the Universe of Thought will bog down in its own rubbish.
<li> Religions are an attempt to stop all cycles at some point of time, and stop all Destruction. This helps a priesthood to live in a style they wish to live in. One must not kill God or anyone's bread ticket.
<li> The Akashic elements.
<ul>
<li> Fire is there to stop one escaping from a mental universe. Expect to find Fire Barriers and Ring-Pass-Nots. In Monotheism, the job of Satan is to prevent one escaping from the clutches of God. If one breaks through Fire, one enters the next universe up in the Universe of Thought. However this may be circular, with never ending layers of Akasha. Destruction kills Fire and thus any circularity.
<li> Water is the element of creation and emotion, and must eventually be destroyed. Karma is similar, but as any historian will tell you, history and personal history is constantly rewritten.
<li> Air is an attempt to understand what has been created, and will make Akasha appear logical, which it is not. Understanding is a trap.
<li> Earth is the happy dumping ground, where rubbish can solidify.
</ul>
</ul>

<b> Psychological Targets and other Rubbish.</b>
</div>
<ul>
<li> Psychotherapy works best when the target is at least partly in the Physical Universe. All items in the Universe of Thought are fair game, and can be recreated if necessary.
<li> When accessing targets outside one's body, make sure one's psychic defences are in good order, because these items bite back.
<li> Psychic Self Defence is priority one. Zen and bad language are extremely useful.
<li> Akasha is best treated as a complete entity, as understanding will only get one bogged down in it.
<li> Alter-Egos are part of a person, yet outside the ego. Thus they appear to be outside a person. When remote viewing the outside world, one must first break through one's own alter-egos.
<li> Gods appear to be a collection or communion of alter-egos which agree to work together. Thus it is legitimate to target a person's God as if it is an alter-ego.
<li> Archetypes are the role models for Gods, and are genetic programming for the ideal course of action, depending on one's age, sex and current activity.
<li> Engrams are currently defined as any incident buried in the subconscious. Expect a fire barrier when accessing them in oneself and other people.
<li> Memes are short cuts to thinking to save one having think afresh. The difference between a meme and an engram is somewhat blurred. Conscious walking is a great help.
<li> Sins of commission and omission, in the self and other people.
<li> Memories especially painful ones.
<li> Astrology contains Zodiacs, planets, astrologers (dead or alive), and fractals of 6 way goals. We can not find the exact source, but it is very Solar System orientated, so it is hard to blame ETs. Thus we blame the Denisovans (Neanderthals) instead. A common source of problems is planets in conflict. People who have tried working through goals report that they have had to give up, as there are too many thousand. Thus treat all goals as one. A weak point of many religions is their astrology, even if they claim not to believe in it.
<li> Schizophrenia comes in 2 varieties. One can do little about medical schizophrenia, and it is most unwise to claim to cure it by psychic or non-medical means. It tends to be too self centred to produce telepathy. Social schizophrenia on the other hand is all about castles in the sky, and is telepathic. Astrology and schizophrenia appear to be the basis of human psychological conditions. If it telepaths, then purge it, otherwise ignore.
<li> If one chases the Source, we have found Denisovan psychology, creators, and creators who dislike destruction, and creators of alter-egos, but no logic.
<li> The most common source of problems arising in remote psychotherapy, is failure to clean up one's own problems.
</ul>

<p><div align=center>
<b> Levels of Remote Viewing and Telepathy.</b>
</div>
<ul>
<li> Telepathy is under the control of the subconscious. Thus it is difficult to control. It is a primitive defence mechanism. Telepathy involves plenty of emotion, mainly negative. As it has been inherited from primitive man, there is little data or numerology. Thus abreaction tends to be emotional rather than understandable.
<li> In the native state, a person can not consciously detect telepathy, and thus its effects become hypnotic. However they may subconsciously relay the telepathy to someone who can handle it, in which case it has no effect on the original recipient.
<li> If a person like a priest has a Tower of Babel, or other construction in the Universe of Thought to defend, he is liable to telepath in order to defend it. Psychics are an anathema as they can receive and dismantle Telepathy. There are some very curious modern religions like True Science with Darwin as its God.
<li> CRV or Coordinate Remote Viewing is a protocol devised by the CIA. If you follow the protocol and strict military discipline, you are reasonably safe. However cynics may claim that the viewer is safe because he is more scared of his commanding officer and risk to his professional employment, than to any disincarnate entity. Is square bashing psycho-therapeutic? Also CRV can behave as a religion and may never be altered, in which case its God is the CIA.
<li> Psychics can interpret other people's telepathy, and dismantle it. They can also help people understand themselves and sort out their problems. This works as long as their Psychic Self-Defences are in order. We have helped quite a number of crashed psychics.
<li> Remote Psychotherapy is safe and does allow for the collection of data as in remote viewing. One must expect to meet every thing your vicar warned you about, and also everything your professor of psychology told you can not possibly exist. Hold your water. There are also one's personal demons. One must fight them all to the death for as long as it takes. Nothing disincarnate is greater than a living being. If one conquers all one's enemies, and is prepared to Wager one's Head, then who is there to attack you? Data can then flow.

<b> The Rules of Remote Viewing.</b>
</div>
<ul>
<li> Observe your enemies. but observe your friends even more. Their agenda will not be quite the same as yours. Their differences can prove embarrassing.
<li> Watch your back, as no else will. Self-defence is all important.
<li> Hold your water. Self-discipline is also all important.
<li> The Universe of Thought can affect humans, but not the Physical Universe.
<li> All Gods, religions, astrologies. memes and systems are human creations in the Universe of thought. They are there to serve man and not visa-versa.
<li> The Universe of Thought can be controlled by psycho-analysis and psycho-therapy, and this includes modern memes.
<li> All this suggests that what is needed is Total Personal Responsibility for Thought, which is usually considered too high for man to consider, but is it? This brings us back to Total Personal Responsibility.
<li> Target all enemy gods, enemy religions, loyalties and anything else which bears you malice. There are some curious loyalties about. This is the ultimate citizen's weapon.
<li> It may be well to target the Universe of Thought as a communications network, rather than deal with the individual creations within. Also inspect the Universe of Telepathy and the Universe of Telekinesis which are closely allied. Physical Telekinesis probably refers to creations in the Physical Universe which are mis-catalogued. All universes other than the Physical Universe are suspect.
<li> The difference between a vampire and a reincarnating spirit may lie in the eye of the beholder.
<li> It doth appear that Purgatory. Heaven and Hell are subsets of the Spirit World and not visa versa.
<li> Good hunting.
</ul>

<p><div align=center>
<b> Nirvana.</b>
</div>
Nirvana may be described Total Sub-conscious Control of the Sub-conscious Brain. In <a href="http://www.viking-z.org/r66.htm">M01. Tables of Emotion for the Brain..</a>, we have tried to make a scale of sub-conscious emotions and abilities and it does not work. If however we attribute each emotion and its associate emotions plus psychic and other abilities, each to a separate part of the sub-conscious brain, then things start to make sense. Items include Responsibility, Control, Choice of Identities, God, Telepathy, Healing, Remote Viewing, and Psychic Abilities.
<p>
Thus we get a network of sub-conscious abilities and emotions, which need to be in balance with the Ego or conscious mind. Some sub-conscious emotions are more important than others like Responsibility, and some can be very dubious like Slavery. Thus Nirvana describes a balance to suit one's environment, and may or may not be part of the brain itself. Nirvana needs training. Mental health problems become symptoms of severe imbalance.

<b> Classifications of Thought.</b>
</div>
 Looking into thought, we have come up with the following provisional classifications -
<ul>
<li> Pictorial thought which is probably the original.
<li> Verbal thought which is quite common.
<li> Conceptual thought. Being able to think outside the box. Seeing the bigger picture. This appears to be the basis of Alter-egos, the type which call themselves God, Allah and Jehovah, Astrology, etc.
<li> Psychic thought. Still investigating, but looks powerful. There is the negative side giving people downloads. There is also the positive side removing negativity. Responsible for Creation and Destruction. Creation memes and alter-egos. Alter-egos are unit of Beingness.
<li> Telekinetic thought. The type normally associated with Poltergeists, with 14 year old teenagers as their epicentres. It may be just a device by teenagers to shed childhood rubbish to allow them to be teenagers, which in extreme cases can express itself as a Poltergeist. The Poltergeist appears to be a unit of Psychic Doingness. It may be that being too understanding with teenagers can be counter productive in suppressing the Poltergeist. The Poltergeist acts a sort of personal God of Destruction Within to destroy obsolete creations. It can cause trouble if it is blocked.
<li> Physical Telekinetic Thought. So far we have found no evidence for its existence, or any connection between the Universe of Thought and the Physical Universe, other than through Man. Thus it is impossible to injure another person though thought. However it is possible to frighten you out of your wits. Pick yourself up and carry on.
<li> Telepathy is a primitive defensive ability of the sub-conscious mind. As with a baby, it has 3 states, contentment, anger, and apathy or sleep. People telepath to defend their minds, or to pass on an overload from other people. The Ego has little or no control over telepathy. If telepathy is received unconsciously, it is hypnotic. If telepathy is received consciously, it can be returned to sender as Remote Psychotherapy.
<li> Cappers and Blockers download Contentment on to a target to prevent them taking revenge.
<li> Mutual Telepathy can come as a result of Remote Psychotherapy, and is a state in which 2 way telepathy can take place. It is surprising how much Remote Viewing can take place, and can take place safely. It comes when the Sub-conscious is in tune with the Ego, and works for it.
<li> The Next Level Up. The connection with the Universe of Anti-matter. If this does exist, it may be near impossible to get into.
<li> Memes are any pre-packaged units of thought.
<li> Alter-Egos are minds belonging to a person, which appear to be completely outside, and are rivals or advisers to the Ego. When people start to look outside themselves, they must first break through their own Alter-Egos.
<li> Automatic Psychotherapy comes when the Sub-conscious is in tune with the Ego, and works for it.
<li> No-Thought is a state of absence of pictorial, verbal or conceptual thought. The subject is usually in Observation Mode, in the Zone, listening with the mind or asleep.
<li> A suggestion is that we live in a psychological universe created by the Denisovans, using their law, and abilities we do not have.

<b> Restore the Archetypes and Archetypal Gods.</b>
</div>
The archetypes are a natural product of one's DNA and unconscious brain. Natural Gods are built upon their framework. They are best cleared down of all acquired rubbish.
<p>
<b>Let the Ego (higher brain) rule the Sub-conscious (reptilian brain).</b>
