<li>The easiest way of applying stimulus to the brain is via ears. Other senses could be used as well, and vision is actually used quite often (often in addition to hearing). However, humans cannot hear sounds low enough to be useful for brain stimulation, so special techniques must be used. One such special technique used is called binaural beats. If the left ear is presented with a steady tone of 500Hz and the right ear a steady tone of 510Hz, these two tones combine in the brain. The difference, 10Hz, is perceived by the brain and is a very effective stimulus for brainwave entrainment. This 10Hz is formed entirely by the brain. When using stereo headphones, the left and right sounds do not mix together until in your brain. The frequency difference, when perceived by brain this way, is called a binaural beat.
<li>
<li> Delta 0.5Hz - 4Hz Deep sleep

<ul>
<li> He uses 14 to 40 Hz if he feels the need to wake up for remote viewing and remote psychotherapy.
<li> He uses the 7.8 Hz Schuman frequency if he feels the need to wind down.
<li> Using a mind machine is only occasionally necessary.
<li> Probably one needs the full range of say 4Hz to 30Hz, and the trick is to exercise any missing gaps.
<li> Anyone showing psychiatric symptoms should stick to say the 4 to 10Hz range until the trouble clears.
<li> If you experience any type of fit while using this type of device, chuck the earphones off immediately, and turn off the machine or computer.
<li> Epileptics are at least twice as liable to get fits from this type of device or flashing lights. There is a bit of argument over the ratio and the blame is normally put on flashing lights.
