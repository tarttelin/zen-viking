<h3> S03. Some Simple Drills </h3> 
<p> 
<b> Intention is all important.
<br> Mean what you say. Say what you mean.
<br> Anyone looking for the secret ingredient should investigate the &quot;Intention of Thor&quot; </b> 
</div> 
<p>
Once conscious walking is working, direction can be considered. 
<p> 
<b> PSYCHIC SELF DEFENCE. </b> Some simple one line commands are below. Remember to mean what you say. Try to identify the target (which is a basic rule in exorcism). 
<ul>
<li> Get thou beyond me Satan!
<li> Honi soit qui mal y pense!
<li> Return all curses to sender!
<li> You will be totally responsible for your actions!
<li> Go and reincarnate yourself.
</ul>
 <b> BEINGNESS - HAMLET. </b> Ask any one to quote Shakespeare's Hamlet, and the answer is bound to be, &quot;To be, or not to be, that is the question&quot;. This is something of great significance to the folk mind, and has great meaning outside Shakespeare's context. Ask any one conversant with the works of Dr Alfred Adler, what is the question. The answer will be a person's goal in life. Put these together, and they become, &quot;To be, or not to be, one's goal in life&quot;. To the ego, the highest form of identity, is beingness, though this is not necessarily true at higher levels.
<p> 
The Hamlet formulae will now be expanded. As an example of a goal, readily understandable to the ego, there is the beingness of the Accountant. There may be no goal in the conceptual language for the mind that quite corresponds, but this is an example. There are three main tenses in the English language, past, present and future. Add in the others, should they become relevant. There is also the positive and negative. The result of expanding the formulae becomes.
<ul> 
<li> To be an accountant.
<li> To not be an accountant.
<li> To become an accountant.
<li> To not become an accountant.
<li> To have been an accountant.
<li> To have not been an accountant.
</ul> 
<p> 
To use beingness drills, pick a goal that might be applicable, and substitute it for an accountant. Go conscious walking. Say each command in turn aloud, or under the breath, and let any discharge of laughter or emotion take place. Then do the same with the next. After completing all six, go back to the first. Repeat the six until none of them give any response. Next find a new possible goal. When the going gets to rough, go back to number one, as the future and especially the past, can be temporarily too heavy. Intention is absolutely necessary, and one must mean what one says. Try talking to the trees. Please remember, that if conscious walking is not mastered, then directed meditation just will not work.
<p> 
The present tense is the easiest to discharge. The future is the next hardest. The difficult stuff is in the past. In case of difficulty, which is quite common, cycle around using the present tense only, or present and future, until the trouble clears. The past will have to be dealt with eventually, before going on to the next goal, but when it can be done easily.
<p> 
The negatives are needed to handle counter intention. There may seem to be more counter intention, than intention. Intention equals counter intention, and the two keep each other in place, but not necessarily in the same tense as each other. The net result is zero. We can discharge the contents of our goals. We are better off recreating them in real time. In case of real trouble, go back to simple conscious walking, until the trouble evaporates.
<p> 
CHEAT THE ZODIAC. The short cut to take out all available goals (and the Zodiac) is as follows.
<ul> 
<li> I am totally responsible for my objectives, etc.
</ul> 
<p> 
REMOTE SENSING - Hamlet has no known use for remote sensing. However it can be very useful when trying to do work on conflicting ET races, to establish which side one is on.
<p> 
<b> REALITY. </b> Reality is something that should occur in real time only. Therefore only the present tense is used. A suitable example, taken from Einstein, is as follows.
<ul> 
<li> The speed of light is relative to the observer.
<li> The speed of light is not relative to the observer.
</ul> 
<p> 
The answer from such a drill, may be largely irrelevant, except in this case, to a true scientist. Anyway the speed of light is relative to the media in which it is travelling and not the observer. The use is similar to a Beingness drill, as one first repeats one side until there is no more emotion to be discharged, and then goes over to the other concept. Repeat the process, until there is no more emotion to be discharged, on either side. If there is no response from saying a command, then it is discharged. If there is no response from either side, then either it has been drained, or there was nothing available in the first place.
<p> 
Chaos is in Real Time, so there can be no past or future. There can only be two states, for and against, or is and is not. The following exercises are offered as examples, for use in directed meditation, while conscious
walking.
<ul> 
<li> Reality is changing.
<li> Reality is not changing
<p> 
<li> Realities are in conflict.
<li> Realities are not in conflict.
</ul> 
<p> 
The above are examples only, and it left to the reader to select and amend as appropriate. A person must expect to be dealing with problems peculiar to his own universe for 90% of the time, which means that he will have to invent his own variations.
<p> 
REALITY FOR REMOTE SENSING PURPOSES. The writer investigated the 1997 Woodborough Crop Circle. A lot of the preliminary work was done by using 2 state reality, and reading the abreaction responses from Spirit. In some ways this is similar to dowsing. Some basic information was needed to find out what to investigate in detail. Examples are below. 
<ul> 
<li> This crop circle was made by Greys.
<li> This crop circle was not made by Greys.
<li> 
<li> This crop circle was made by Nordics.
<li> This crop circle was not made by Nordics.
<li> 
<li> This crop circle was made by humans.
<li> This crop circle was not made by humans.
</ul>

THE TREE OF LIFE and OBSOLETE GOALS. There is probably nothing more depressing than being stuck in an obsolete goal, regardless of whether it is one of our own or imposed from elsewhere. The writer does have archetypal memories of the Tree of Life as a fractal (snowflake or mathematical) pattern where each leaf is a group of goals. When one is stuck in an obsolete goal or objective, it is time to move on. One can either purge the goal or the whole Tree of Life using Hamlet. The following should work sometime.
<ul>
<li> To be the Tree of Life.
<li> To not be the Tree of Life.
<li> To become the Tree of Life.
<li> To not become the Tree of Life.
<li> To have been the Tree of Life.
<li> To have not been the Tree of Life.
</ul> 
The GPM or Goal (or Game) Problem Mass is something one can encounter, and can appear as units on the Tree of Life. It is nearly a self evident truth that where there are imposed goals there will be problems, and where there are problems one is likely to have a black mass hanging over one.
<p>
This whole area is one of enforced goals. It is rather like playing a never ending football match.

<p>
The GCM or Game Cycle Mass is also worth considering. Few people can hold an active goal longer than 9 years. Few people have been in direct selling for more than 9 years. The rot sets in for most people after 9 years in prison. In the case of the game of life, most people retire at 65 as this the age entropy starts to really step in. All time cycles gather mass which leads to their end.

<b> Creation and Uncreation </b> must be kept in balance for reasonable enlightenment, otherwise there will be an overload of creation. The normal state of affairs is that there is an overload of creation which no one dares uncreate. The following is also part of section M20, mentioned in Index-2005 - website index as in 2005.
<ul>
<li> I / we / you will create, etc.
<li> I will uncreate.
<li> I will become able to create.
<li> I will become able to uncreate.
<li> I have created.
<li> I have uncreated.
</ul>

<b> Blasphemy and Swearing </b> are very useful in cutting any target down to size. However the more they are used, the less effective they become.
