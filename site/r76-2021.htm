<h3>The Source.</h3>
In many cultures there are folk memories of an ancient super race, and their civilisations which are now extinct. They have various names like the Elohim, Nefilim, Atlantians and Lemurians. Now if such a civilisation had access to telepathy, remote viewing, illusion and delusion, then there would be little need for technology as we know it. They would also give their victims plenty of reason for killing them or at least avoiding them. They could make a cave look like a palace, and thus were expert at enslaving others. All civilisations fail when they become degenerate, and perhaps their use of slaves led to their degeneration. Candidates known to science include the Denisovans and Neanderthals, but there have been plenty of other races of man which no longer exist. Some are included in our blood ancestors, while others are not.
<p>
Now the limitations of computers are governed by their architecture using serial operation of bits which can be either on or off. Similarly human thought is limited by the architecture of our brains.  If the brains of members of lost civilisations were wired up in a slightly  different architecture to our own, they would have had different ways of thinking and different abilities to ourselves. Perhaps mercifully, we will never understand schizophrenic technology, but they did and left their psychic machinery behind.
<p>
A common thread in folklore is that they were so advanced that they gave up meat bodies and adopted etheric bodies instead.  Now the rude name for an etheric  body is Vampire, as they need the living to continue their existence, to provide thinking capacity and energy.  If one forgives the original source whether it it is in the Spirit World, Lost Dimensions of Quantum Physics or just the Sea of Memory, then all the Machinery of the Universe dependent on it will come crashing down, and Man will have to think for himself.
<p>
Thus if we target the Original Sinner or Original A******e, and forgive them their sins, we should get there eventually. However this does not appear to account for astrology. Obviously with its reference to the planets in the Solar System, astrology was generated on Earth. However the obvious may be wrong, as the Original Astrologer appear to precede the Original Sinner. That does not stop us forgiving the sins of astrology and the original astrologer, or what ever created it.
<p>
Nowadays we concentrate on the obsolete creations of yesterday past their use by date, in the role of God the Destroyer, and target engrams, memes, zodiacs, astrologies, creators, sources and obsolete loyalties.
<p>
<a name="astro"></a>
<a name="mindmap"></a>
<h3>Mind Maps.</h3>
A Mind Map of the human brain is the master view a person has of the universe in which they live. It is their view of the physical universe as filtered by their engrams, astrologies, schizophrenias, illusions, delusions, and memories real or imagined. It is thus a bridge between the secular and the occult, and is a basket for all mental rubbish from the past. It is a short cut to thinking, essential for fast thought and automatic reactions. Loki does have his uses. However it does need to be kept up to date. They control what you are allowed to think and do.
<p>
There is plenty on conscious mind mapping on the internet, but this is the bigger picture and tends to be a psychological side of the Science of Perception. However even master mind maps have to follow cycles of creation - Create, Change, Destroy. Destruction at this level can handle astrologies. In S08 - <a href="http://www.viking-z.org/d57.htm">Current RV model..</a>, replace &quot;Total Free Reincarnation&quot; with &quot;Total Free Creation / Change / Destruction&quot;.
<p>
Now Jesus preached Forgiveness, healing and love. We have been looking at mind maps to see if the 2 sides can be combined. Test the following.
<br>
<b>Forgiveness of Sin</b> wiped out Mithras and the Greek and Roman Gods. It worked marvellously well when no one bothered to define what sin was, which is in line with modern psychotherapy. Then along came the Church and defined sin and morality, and the work of JC has not been the same since. This a case of sorting out logic.
<br><b>Healing</b> is an emotion of the reptilian brain. Now if one's sub-conscious emotions are in order then one's emotion of healing should be able to heal one's own body. Thus the trick in healing another person is to insure their emotions are in order especially healing.
<br><b>Love.</b> In a state of total love, morality and ethics are irrelevant. Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. In Eastern religion, this becomes the virtuous path of right living. In a state of total love, anarchy prevails. JC never preached anarchy, but is probably the biggest anarchist of all time.
<p>
<br>Now if we convert these into mind maps we get at least 3.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Logical Mind Maps.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emotional Mind Maps of the reptilian brain emotions.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moral Mind Maps.
<br>Reality Mind Maps also look possible, so this list is incomplete, and the limit is governed by one's imagination.
<br>While there is little or no evidence for Physical Telekinesis in the Physical Universe, Telekinesis is a powerful for destruction and cleaning of thought in the Universe of Thought. There is little or no evidence of the Universe of Thought being able to operate in the Physical Universe, except by using man as an intermediary. Thus Telekinetic Mind Maps are worth a look.
<p>
<a name="advantage"></a>
<h3>Strengths & Weaknesses of Remote Psychotherapy.</h3>
<ul>
<li> It is subject to the Law of Diminishing Returns.
<li> People in distress telepath, while people in a quiet state of mind tend to receive telepathy.
<li> The usual causes of distress are that people have an overload, or that they are villains who do not wish to be found out.
<li> Any telepath can be hijacked and used as a slave to work on a third party.
<li> It is the survival of the fittest.
<li> If people know that other people are doing the work, then they mistakenly believe that they do not have to do anything.
<li> People are quite content to sit back and leave things to a "Messiah".
<li> While every little bit helps, the emphasis may be on the word "Little". However one should be able to punch well above one's weight.
<li> It is remarkably hard to change the mind of someone who is paid to be the way they are.
<li> The weakest part of any hierarchy is its apex.
<li> Remote Psychotherapy may be better at releaving the stress of the victim rather than changing the mind of the target.
<li> It probably works best when there are many therapists involved, preferably a large chunk of society.
<li> This sort of work gets no praise when things go right, and all the blame when things go wrong.
<li> Partial success is liable to be seen as complete failure.
<li> Some of the best potential targets are the superior officers of the remote psychotherapists.
<li> Some of the best current targets are obsolete religions.
<li> Targets also include amateur email tappers who have a personal agenda, and who have not done anything to clean up their minds.
<li> There is plenty of rubbish from obsolete religion and race to clean up.
</ul>
<p>
<a name="hiearchy"></a>
<h3> The Hierarchy of Telepathy.</h3>
<ul>
<li> Physical Telekinesis is at the top, and involves moving objects in the Physical Universe by means of thought. There is very little evidence for its existence. This may be because it does not exist, or because it takes up so much psychic energy as to make it uneconomic. The movement of genes and chromosomes looks the most promising area for proof. There is plenty of propaganda to protect the guilty to convince you that it exists.
<li> Remote Schizophrenia. This is the stuff of religion, race and politics. To comment further can be blasphemy, heresy and highly illegal. Expect plenty of telekinesis to protect the guilty. Schizophrenia must convince everyone that they are sinners, and this can only be forgiven by strictly following the rules of the religion.
<li> Remote Telekinesis is the Shock and Awe element of Telepathy. It involves the movement of mental objects in the Universe of Thought. It involves the good, the bad and the ugly, and is probably the highest active emotion of the reptilian brain. It is a good target to clean up, as it contains all the bully boy rubbish of yesterday.
<li> Remote Psychotherapy involves psychoanalysis at a distance. This is good for cleaning up all mental rubbish. It works best when the target is in a state of distress or has an overload.
<li> Remote viewing involves looking at people and objects at a distance by telepathic or psychic means. This is the ability favoured by intelligence agencies, as it does nothing to disturb the target. However the remote viewer must be on a level of psychic cleanliness above that of the target, otherwise he is liable to download his mind on the target, which gives him away and causes great offence to the target.
<li> Telepathy involves the transfer of thought from person to person in the Universe of Thought. It is a product of the reptilian mind, and the higher conscious mind is not involved. People in distress tend to telepath their thoughts. People in a quiet state of mind tend to receive telepathy.
<li> Most Psychic activity can be explained in terms of telepathy.
</ul>
<p>
<a name="schiz"></a>
<h3> A View of Schizophrenia, Apocalypse, Telekinesis and the Epileptic Fire Flow.</h3>
<ul>
<li> Schizophrenia tends to be a hierarchy with the successful ones at the top, like political and religious leaders, into whose dreams we buy into. The unsuccessful ones are at the bottom and are only of interest to the psychiatrist.
<li> Schizophrenia is the result of too much creation without enough destruction of creations which are past their use by date.
<li> This is a hierarchy of mind control and charisma.
<li> It is also a hierarchy of vampirism.
<li> Both religion and psychotherapy tend to shift a person away from bi-polarism towards schizophrenia.
<li> An interest in people is an aid to schizophrenic success.
<li> Being connected to the physical universe is an aid to keeping schizophrenia in order.
<li> Watch out for the games people play. This is a great area for playing games on the unwary, for sympathy, control and other reasons.
<li>
<li> The natural psychological remedy for too much creation is Apocalypse, when creations collapse under their own weight, and look ridiculous.
<li> Everything can have its own apocalypse.
<li> This leads on to the Master Apocalypse or Apocalypse of Reptilian Brains.
<li> The natural body remedy to schizophrenia is the Epileptic Fire Flow. Epilepsy is a flow which will burn up all excess mental creations if it is not blocked. Blocking this flow leads to fits and medical epilepsy.
<li> This is where the Epileptic flow meets Telekinesis, and they appear to be 2 sides of the same coin.
<li> Surt makes a good god of both epilepsy and telekinesis. He is violent enough.
</ul>
<p>
<a name="influencing"></a>
<h3>Remote Influencing and Mind Control.</h3>
<ul>
<li> Remote Influencing and Mind Control are strictly for the pure in heart.
<li> Using this negatively causes great offence if found out, and has got plenty of people murdered, who protested their innocence.
<li> Using negativity for one's own agenda creates negative feedback from the targets, which drive the user downhill and towards the lunatic asylum.
<li> Positive remote psychotherapy is normally welcomed by honest men. If it is detected, targets generally sit back and enjoy, and ladies regard it as an act of love. If it is not detected, then the target puts any positive effects down to his own intelligence.
<li> Positive remote psychotherapy is generally unwelcome by villains who have their own agenda or profit by being stuck in the past.
<li> The forgiveness of sin works well when sin is left undefined. Similarly what is positive and what is negative is a matter of ethics and morality, and can not be defined here.
<li> No government, president, God or religion can turn the negative into the positive.
<li> Commanding foreign targets to forgive or destroy anything greater than one's country may be permissible. Anything in the Spirit of positive psychotherapy should also be permissible. “The ends justify the means” can be a very dangerous path, especially if one does not fully inspect both the means and the ends.
<li> A fundamental limitation of psychotherapy is that it is near impossible to change anyone who is paid to be the way they are. Thus it is near impossible to change the views of a foreign rogue politician on one's own, as any show of softness is liable to result in the death of the politician. Now it only takes one person to do a remote viewing job. To change the views of a rogue president probably needs one hundred people working together, and possibly more. This is also known as peer pressure.
<li> Remote Schizophrenia can raise its ugly head, if one does too much negative stuff. Remote Schizophrenia originates from the Source, whatever that may be, and can be viewed as a miasma or morphic field. It pre-dates organised religion, and forms the foundations of organised religion. Thus it is higher up the negative hierarchy than most apocalypses. However it is still a beingness, and falls victim to doing.
<li> The Source can turn into the Acquired Memory Syndrome, which may in turn become Acquired Astrological Memories. Acquired memories can be every bit as real as real memories.
<li> Please note that since the Apocalypse in 2012, which no one noticed, we are no longer in the hierarchical house of Pisces, but in the democratic house of Aquarius. People are already complaining about the Tyranny by the Majority. On a personal level, the effect of astrology depends on personal beliefs. However the larger the group, the more valid it becomes.
</ul>
<p>
<a name="astrology"></a>
<h3>Astrology.</h3>
<ul>
<li> Astrology appears to predate all known religions, and has its origins before recorded history.  Therefore there is no known original maintenance manual.
<li> All information given here is speculative, but that is no reason for not starting to investigate. Thus any information given here may be proved wrong at a later date.
<li> Its possible origins include Denisovans, Neanderthals, Druids and Sufis, as well as ETs and their star systems. There is also the mythical planet Nibiru, said by the Sumerians to be the home planet of Jehovah and the Elohim. Nibiru appears to be an astrological entity and not a physical one, and therefore any return near Earth is unlikely to destroy Earth, but will play havoc with all users of astrology. You do your own investigation as the source of astrology is probably a mixture of the above.
<li> Allow for astrological logic, superimposed on our own for the survival of astrology. Currently Man does not like emptiness and voids, which favours astrology as it needs you to accept an irritant, namely astrology.
<li> Zodiacs appear to be strings of goals, to many to handle individually, each of which has 6 states as mentioned in <a href="d02i.htm"> Section S02.. </a> and <a href="d03j.htm">Section S03.. </a>
<li> Allow for multiple astrologies.
<li> Zodiacs, astrological houses and astrologies may be in conflict with their peers, and just about everything else. They all jostle for power.
<li> Each astrological house can have its own schizophrenia, probably due to rubbish left by winners to control losers. Check the astrological birth houses of medical schizophrenics.
<li> Allow for Zodiac Warfare and Astrological Warfare, Astrological Peace Communist style, and the resting places on the planets of  dead astrologers. Also allow for things which no longer exist, like memories. Also everything can turn into an illusion.
<li> The great apocalypse of 2012, which no one noticed, was in the Universe of Thought, and not the physical universe. It was the change over from the hierarchical Pisces to the more democratic Aquarius or revolution or the tyranny by the majority depending on one's viewpoint. Piscean magic no longer works, hence the apocalypse for its users. As all mainstream religions are hierarchical, this puts their magic now in doubt. Cabalism now has similar problems.
<li> Allow for Creators and Destroyers. Now if we can create and destroy astrological entities, then we are doing so within a universe which is more basic than the astrological universe.
<li> Skeptics like asking the question, &quot;What does one think about when in No-thought&quot;. The answer is that one is either in observation mode or asleep.
<li> Remember that you are a living entity, and therefore greater than any dead astrology, even if astrology tells you otherwise. The might of astrology is an illusion.
</ul>
<p>
<a name="apocalypse"></a>
<h3>The Apocalypse of Astrology.</h3>
<ul>
<li> Like everything else, astrology has an apocalypse to prevent you unwinding it. It is an illusion, even if it claims to be the Big Bang itself.
<li> The origins of astrology remain obscure. At present, it looks like a naturally evolving system created by Original Sinners and Astrologists, created to keep the peasants in order. The big problem with systems like this, is that they eventually trap their creators into the system they created. Systems like astrology may the natural outcome consciousness and the understanding of consciousness. Astrology may be responsible for civilisation, but we hope not.
<li> Astrology with its predestination has advantages for a society with a limited genetic pool and a standard unchanging environment. We hope this is not a look into Man's future.
<li> However do we really want predestination and a planned life.
<li> Look at one's life goals, as they may be of astrological origin.
<li> Look on Google for the goals and objectives of the astrological houses and astrological planets. From the objectives one can divine the magical systems of each, like hierarchies, communication, democracy, logic, fascination, etc.
<li> Target the goals, objectives and magic of each house and planet, to crash through the apocalypse. These targets look anything but marvellous in the cold light of day, when illusion and delusion are stripped away.
<li> Apocalypses are liable to turn into engrams. Target Every Original Apocalypse / Engram / Sinner / Creator, etc. Give Destruction a free rein.
</ul>
<p>
<a name="law"></a>
<h3>The Apocalypses of the Law and Schizophrenia.</h3>
<ul>
<li> This is a political minefield as the Law and Psychosis are heavily intertwined.
<li> The penalty in the UK for Contempt of Court is 12 months in prison.
<li> Whereas the origins of many thing lie well into the past, the Law, social order and paranoid schizophrenia are maintained by people currently alive.
<li> The Law contains some general agreements like on which side of the road to  drive.
<li> The Law also contains expressions of the Paranoid Schizophrenia of the ruling classes, to keep the peasants in order.
<li> There are Obsessive Compulsive Law Makers, a major sin of the European Union.
<li> There are also those who wish to Punish the Guilty, and when they run out of the guilty, they invent criminal law to keep up the stock of the guilty to punish.
<li> Ignorance of the law is not an allowed excuse, but the average house does not have enough space to store copies of all legal statutes and instruments.
<li> In an ideal world, a copy of each new law and statute should be delivered to every household on the date of implementation.
<li> The fantasies and legends of religion are kept alive by people currently alive.
<li> There are also immigrants who claim more rights for their race and religion than the indigenous population, and then shout racism against everyone who objects.
<li> Then there are the Politically Correct who change the law to suit fashion faster than a lady's fashion house, and turn the pursuit of virtue into a psychosis.
<li> There are too many instances of legal injustice, often against people who trust the law, so be prepared to defend yourself against the law.
<li> Target everyone who bares malice towards you, regardless of who they are.     There was the law of the old Wild West, “Do unto others before they do unto you”.
<li> Look at everything afresh.
<li> Target all apocalypses, as they sit at the top of all hierarchies.
</ul>
<a name="apex"></a>
<p>
<h3> Apex Apocalypses.</h3>
<ul>
<li> All apex apocalypses are in current time, and not in historic or pre-historic times.
<li> Along with the apocalypses of the law and paranoid schizophrenia come the apocalypses of religion, sex, sin, original sin and politics, and any other one can think of.
<li> Apocalypses tend to turn into engrams, which may turn into thunderbolts. This puts a new dimension on to the Wars of the Gods.
<li> The Apocalypse of Beingness outranks the others.
<li> Beingness is an addictive drug. There is a delusion (not shared by Buddhists) that any beingness is better than no beingness, even if it is an engram or astrological entity.
<li> Beingness must be kept dynamic, and not allowed to become static.
<li> Love and the Forgiveness of Sin outrank just about everything else, provided they are given teeth and used with intelligence. Unfortunately the Christian Church has emasculated both in order for the Church to gain control over the people.
<li> Take a look at -
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Denisovan Astrological Engrams.
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Denisovan Beingness Engrams.
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Sins of the Denisovans. Were they the original slave masters?
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="r70.htm#denis70"> M01.31</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="r75.htm#denis75"> M01.36</a>
<li> The Forgiveness of Original Sin appears to be the best psychological remedy for schizophrenia. The Original Sinners are whoever set up your religion.
<li> Look also at Schizophrenic Technology from the source, Religious Technology in the present, and the Original Schizophrenic.
<li> Look also at Epileptic Technology, the alleged nemesis of schizophrenia, and just Sub-conscious Technology which being sub-conscious is hard to observe.
<li> Look???? at Natural, Reptilian Brain and Psychic Technologies, if you can.
</ul>
<a name="stech"></a>
<p>
<h3> Schizophrenic Technology and Psychotronics.</h3>
<ul>
<li> This section is somewhat speculative, due to our inability to think consciously in the unconscious mind.
<li> Our reference to Schizophrenic Technology refers to to that of the ancients, while Psychotronics are usually blamed on governments. However if one can understand one, one can probably understand the other
<li> As the unconscious is below the level of consciousness, seeing its contents is difficult but not impossible if one is prepared to look at it via all angles, and prepared to command the unconscious to do things. Viewing detail is impossible, but one can target Real Time Lunacies, like Astrological Lunacies such as Piscean and Aquarian Lunacies.
<li> The conscious logical mind has little control of the unconscious. However a good grip of the physical world is a great aid to reality in the physical world, and a great aid to the destruction of unconscious psychological machines past their use by date. If one lets the unconscious take over completely, the result can land one in the lunatic asylum.
<li> The origins of all political, religious and other control systems lie in the unconscious. It has created the world you live in in times past. It is currently maintained by schizophrenics untroubled by psychiatrists.
<li> Old systems in the unconscious mind may have originally been survival, even if they are now obsolete. This can be a window into the minds of less evolved animals. It is survival to be an alpha male or female.
<li> It is only possible to enter the level of Schizophrenic Technology when one has control over all active past schizophrenic technology creations like astrology and engrams.
<li> When looking into this, or rather trying to look into the unconscious, one should first look at one's own schizophrenic technology and work outwards.
<li> There is an apocalypse of schizophrenic technology, so there is probably an apocalypse of the unconscious mind.
</ul>
<p>
<b> For future reference - Speculation -</b>
<ul>
<li> The Forgiveness of Sin (unspecified), Understanding.
<li> Psychopomposity. (Forgiving the Dead their Sins, to allow them to move on.)
<li> The Apocalypses of Universes, Creation and Destruction.
<li> Pisceans, Aquarians, Astrological houses.
<li> Everything that exists or no longer exists, Alpha Existences. It is impossible to destroy anything useful in real time, as it will just be regenerated.
<li> Paranoias, Schizophrenias, lunacies and Insanities.
<li> The Apocalypse of Existence (cf Buddhist Non-existence).
<li> Alpha Reptilian Brains.
<li> There is a strong connection between Akashic Fire, Apocalypse, Epilepsy and the stuff which holds engrams and other rubbish together. Epilepsy only becomes medical when it is blocked.
</ul>
<p>
<b> Energy Flows - Speculation - </b>
<ul>
<li> All mental objects are liable to turn into energy flows, or reveal themselves as black masses.
<li> All flows tend to have positive and negative aspects.
<li> The Schizophrenic flow (Creation) and the Epileptic flow (Destruction, Apocalyptic) are the 2 which control psychology and most mental objects, especially when the flows become fossilised and static.
<li> Other flows may include Healing / Disease, Love / Hate, Dowsing and Geomagnetic, Psycho-therapeutic / Control, Telekinetic, Forgiveness / Justice, Religious (including Atheist and Skeptic). and Psychopompic flows. There are many others, only limited by one's imagination.
<li> Reptilian Brains > Sub-conscious minds > Psychological flows > Psychological solid rubbish.
<li> Reptilian Brain Warfare.
<li> Survival, but some obsolete survival mechanisms look mighty peculiar.
<li> Our current view of astrology (until we change it) is that a dying ancient race of ETs decided to leave a psychic model of their civilisation, culture and knowledge, for any future race to pick up and use. This was picked by early man, and adapted to our Solar System. It may look highly attractive, but in the cold light of morning looks more like a vicious control system rather than a fountain of enlightenment. Look out for the possibility of astrology being a vehicle for ET vampires. Each house appears to have its own gods, and systems of magic. We have just changed (2012) from the hierarchical house of Pisces to the more democratic house of Aquarius, which is currently causing a lot of political and religious instability. The priests of Pisces are trying to hang on to their power at all costs.
<li> The apocalypse of astrology (and anything else coming to view).
</ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li> Every apocalypse that dare defy us / does not dare defy us.
<li> The apocalypses of the Universal Sub-conscious and Schizophrenia, Universal Apocalypse.
<li> Every loyal reptilian brain, every loyal brain, every loyal telepath, Universal Telepathy.
<li> The Quantum Universe, unfortunately only viewable via the sub-conscious mind. See <a href="http://www.viking-z.org/r54.htm"> M01.16 - Quantum Physics and the Master Zodiac.</a>
<li> Everything tends to turn into memories of pain. Memories of pain are quite as real as any pain in real time. Acquired memories of pain are quite as painful as ones one has actually experienced.
<li> The Quantum Physics Universe (home to Dark Matter and Energy which make up over 80% of our universe), our adventures in the Quantum Universe, Quantum Entities, Quantum Memory, Quantum Pain and Quantum A*******s. Sorry no information available, but they can be experienced.
<li> Grandmasters of the Quantum Universe, Grandmasters of Schizophrenia, etc.
</ul>
<br>
Perhaps we should be talking about Remote Operations and not Remote Viewing.
