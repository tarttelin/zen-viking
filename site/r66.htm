<b>The meditational exercises in S01 to S08 are needed to make this section work. If things get too heavy, go back to S01 and work forward again. The information here may be in other parts of the site. </b>
<p>
<ul>
<li> The conscious higher brain is made up of the logical left hand side, and the more artistic and intuitive right hand side.
<li> The primitive reptilian brain is at the top of the spinal cord. It includes the pineal body or third eye.  Working out the emotions of the primitive reptilian brain is extremely difficult, as it involves viewing the sub-conscious.
<li> Making lists involves making assumptions that one knows what is at the top, and what is at the bottom.
<li> There is a possibility that every part of the brain has its own set of emotions.
<li> Another problem with linear lists is that they may not be linear,
<li> One must assume that all emotions are there at all times. At any one time, only a few will be active. This does allow one to wake up emotions one did not think one had.
</ul>
<p>
<b> A Table of Ego and the Higher Conscious Brain Emotions. </b><br> This involves the left hand side (logical) and right hand side (artistic) of the higher brain. This is a combination from observation, psychiatric and other sources. This does assume that the 2 sides of the brain share a similar pattern of emotions, which may not be true once one starts looking into detail. Please note that when one is working on the emotions of the Sub-conscious or Reptilian Brain, one has to drag these items through the Conscious Emotions, which can be a bit confusing.
<ul>
<li>Conscious Extroversion.
<ul>
<li> When mind and thought are there but do not matter. Who cares!!!! (Here we are outside all minds.)
<ul> 
<li> Exhilaration, Bliss. Serenity. 
<li> Work, Play.
</ul>
</ul>
<li> Body Emotions.
<ul> 
<li> Survival for all. Positive actions.
<ul> 
<li> Enthusiasm.
<li> Interest.
<li> Conservatism.
<li> Contentment, Boredom. (This tends to be the Balance Point.)
</ul> 
<li> Survival for self. Defensive action.
<ul> 
<li> Antagonism.
<li> Anger. 
<li> Concealed hostility.
<li> Fear.
<li> Pain.
</ul> 
<li> Survival for no one. Self destruction.
<ul> 
<li> Sympathy.
<li> Propitiation.
<li> Grief.
<li> Death. 
</ul> </ul> </ul>
<p> The above table takes no account is taken of the Fates Worse than Death like Blame, Shame and Regret, for a body cannot drop below Death.
<p>
There are plenty of other emotions, but these appear to be associated with various parts of the brain. Thus any lists or scales which appear are constantly changing. However if one gets all emotions of the sub-conscious mind in communion with each other, then one can experience Nirvana.
<p>
<div align=center>
<b> Emotions and Remote Viewing. </b>
</div>
<ul>
<li> The levels of remote viewing tend to follow the emotions of the ego, but not exactly. This is probably because the emotions of the ego have a sub-conscious counterpart.
<li> Telepathy tends to equate to panic, fear, pain or distress.
<li> Magic tends to equate to covert anger. One man's white magic is another man's black magic. Now everyone expects all priests, regardless of religion, to use a bit of magic to protect themselves and their religion. However if the priest over does it, then this is likely to be detected, resulting in irate rival religions, rude words and possible retaliation. Victims generally get the source wrong.
<li> Remote viewing tends to equate to contentment, balance and military discipline. A military remote viewer should be trying to get data without doing anything (or being found out).
<li> A psychic usually works with the consent of the target to solve the problems of the target. Problems can arise when the psychic strays into non consensual areas.
<li> Remote psychotherapy tends to work in the interest enthusiasm area, though military discipline does help. Psychic self-defence is all important. This is something no telepath can resist. It is an area where one has to fight all the way, or be swamped by black magic. It is where modern psychotherapy works in the style of the Viking Sagas. However in order to work, remote psychotherapy needs targets that are in distress, are villains practising magic, or have an overload from a third party.
</ul>
<p>
<div align=center>
<b> The Emotions of the Meta-Conscious.
<br> A Scale of Psychic Warfare.  </b>
</div>
<ul>
<li> There are certain things which need to be considered in the list below.
<ul>
<li> There is no observable confection between the the Universe of Thought in which this table operates and the Physical Universe.
<li> There are 2 main dualities which overlap. There is Creation versus Destruction which makes up Mind Control. There is also Mind Control versus Nirvana.
<li> There appears to be a mirror of the Emotions of the Ego in the Emotions of the Meta-Conscious, which is far from obvious.
<li> Many of the emotions or actions below are subject to Free Will, if we wish to have Free Will.
<li> Thus this list is speculative, but we believe it to be more right than wrong. However people and fashions change, so expect the unexpected.
<li> Most religions prefer to put Beingness above Doing, and Moral Codes above Action. This is important for keeping the peasants in order. It also prevents people destroying any particular religion. However we prefer to be free.
<li> We may be looking at the Secrets of the Denisovans, Atlantians and Frost Giants, but we suspect they used it in the reverse direction.
<li> This list does not include obvious emotions like Love, and Slavery, which probably belong to separate parts of the brain.
<li> We have left out Physical Telekinesis which may or may not exist.
<li> All levels may be active at any one time, but some will be far more active than others. This list may also be in the wrong order. Both Doing and Being are essential at the same time, the question is what is the right balance.
<li> As a weapon of war, Remote Psychotherapy is useful for gaining the Hearts and Minds of the enemy, as well as the local peasants. It can preempt shooting wars. However Shock and Awe is also very important.
<li> Psychic Warfare favours those on a higher level. It also favours newer and dynamic religions. When used by people on a lower level, it will taken as a black magic attack, and will invite retribution. Getting it wrong can lead to genocide.
<li> How one handles these emotions probably depends one's concepts of Responsibility.
<li> We suffer from the rubbish of a few thousand years of civilisation, which we have not bothered to clean up.
<li> We have not bothered to clean up the immortal Universal Sub-Conscious, or immortal Alter-Egos.

<ul>
<li>Primitive and Original Religions.
<li>Reincarnation.
<li>The Denisovan Universe.
<li>Paranormal Universe. (This deals with the dawn of consciousness or self consciousness, say 100,000 years ago. It deals with how to survive, finding meat on the hoof, the survival of the family, and how avoid rival cave men.
<li>Schizophrenic or Psychotic Universes linked to the Paranormal Universe, and modern medical psychosis..
<li>The Water Universe of say 300 million years ago.
<li>The Big Bang. (The greatest possible engram.)
<li>Eternal Intelligence.
<li>The Primitive Reptilian Brain.
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>
Now we take the male military viewpoint, but some people prefer to live in an ordered universe. Also as it stands, it does not suit the female viewpoint which usually prefers a more ordered universe, as this favours a safe environment for bringing up children. There are also people who like an ordered universe for political or religious reasons. Some Russians look back fondly on the Soviet era.
<p>
Now there is a cult who say <b>Be, Do, Have </b> shalt be the law. We of a military disposition believe the ideal to be a state of Perpetual Destruction and Recreation. Religion is there to serve the people and not visa versa. In other words,<b> Do, Be, Have.</b> At least the cult is honest.
<p>
<div align=center>
<b> Immortality. </b>
</div>
<p>
Immortality in the sense we normally know it, appears to belong to Beingness and not Doingness. If one is in a state of doingness, then one is too busy being in present time to worry about the past or the future. Only beingnesses have to worry about survival in the sense that we normally know it. However beingnesses are hardly living entities however much they claim to be. If they are living, then they are very low life. Thus if we wish to shed all rubbish and return to Gaia on a higher level, then we must shed all low life. Thus target all immortal souls, Akasha, Karma, memes, engrams, zodiacs, astrologies and what ever our ancestors and Denisovans left behind to leave us free to rejoin Gaia.
<p>
Some people prefer to live in a totally ordered universe. Some people like living under Communism and Fascism. If you follow the advice of the Church, little should go wrong in your life, but you may find life a bit too boring. A balance is needed between continuity and chaos.
<p>
<b> Telepathy. </b> It looks like we are are looking at a spectrum of telepathy. There is also the possibility of a variety of telepathies. Can we incorporate dowsing into a general theory? Universal Telepathy appears antagonistic to Owners, Downloaders, Controllers, Immortal Alter-Egos and Vampires. It is charitable to allow one's ancestors to live on as alter-egos. It is unwise to give houseroom to people one has not known in life. Target Alter-egos in conflict and Denisovans in conflict. Draw your own conclusions.
<p>
<div align=center>
<b> Dismantling versus Creation. </b>
</div>
<ul>
<li> There is an old joke - Psychotics build castles in the air, neurotics live in them and psychiatrists collect the rent.
<li> Creations and agreements are necessary to bring some order into chaos. It is advisable to agree to drive on the same side of the road as other people. Animals have conventions to prevent serious fighting. Such conventions need to be cancelled when they no longer serve a useful purpose.
<li> In the list above on Psychic Warfare, it is obvious that it is written from the view point of a Dismantler or Destroyer and not a Creator. Any church would tip the list upside down, and put Creation at the top, but we decline the job.
<li> At least one cult says &quot;One has to Be, in order to Do, in order to Have.&quot; We agree that while money is mighty useful, it does not buy happiness or ability. We prefer Destruction over Beingness to prevent us drowning in our own rubbish.
<li> Are you a Dismantler or Creator, or do you prefer a balance?
</ul>
<div align=center>
<b>Psychic Energy versus Schizophrenia.</b>
</div>
<br>
It now appears that everything obsolete in the Universe of Beingness or Ordered Universe is now turning into Schizophrenia. Now if no one agrees with your realities, then you are medically Schizophrenic. If your realities agree with other people's realities, then you are socially Schizophrenic. If you use self evident realities as in the Physical Universe, and no one complains, then you can claim to be normal. Thus we can target obsolete Gods and religions, and also their successors like Socialism, National Socialism and Communism which also share their virtues and vices. In the meantime we shall continue to drive on the same side of the road as other people.
<p>
Things now become a battle between Psychic Energy and obsolete creations, which in times past were created to give us a comfortable life. If we refuse to do clean ups, we will be strangled by our obsolete creations. Psychic Energy appears interchangeable with existing creations. Look for locks on Psychic Energy.
<p>
<ul>
Useful target include -
<li> Everyone who still needs Schizophrenia. (This is a nod to Surt, Viking God of Destruction, and God of Man who no longer needs Gods.)
<li> Every loyal Schizophrenic,
<li> ...... will destroy everyone who has been betrayed, or has betrayed them.
<li> ...... will destroy every rival Schizophrenic.
<li> Every Psychic Energy will do,
<li> ...... will destroy everything greater than Psychic Energy.
</ul>
<div align=center>
<b>Exercise for students.</b>
</div>
The above list of meta emotions can never be correct or in the right order. Rewrite the list as you believe to be correct.
<p>
<div align=center>
<b>Types of Psychotherapy.</b>
</div>
<ul>
<li><b>Religious Psychotherapy.</b> This religion and designed to keep the priesthood in bread. It is designed to keep beingness as king, and is very hierarchical. Expect black magic to maintain the status quo.
<li><b>Scientific Psychotherapy</b> does not recognise anything psychic, and is poor on social interaction.
<li><b>Military Psychotherapy</b> recognises social and psychic interaction, and puts doingness as king, and destroys unwanted beingness.
</ul>
