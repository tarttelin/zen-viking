<b> The Transmigration of Souls.</b>
</div>
<p>
Around 1960 in Spiritualist circles, there was a legend that 6,000 years ago there was a migration of souls from a dying planet. Now when one types &quot;The Transmigration of Souls&quot; into Google, one gets articles on reincarnation only. Since the 1960s, we have heard various possible variations on the original. We hear that in the Hindu religion, there are 30,000,000 Gods. Then there are some who maintain that the original population of Nibiru, or Planet X as mentioned by Zecheria Sitchin, as the original home of the Elohim, was also 30,000,000. Then there is Hubbard, who in his Scientology OT3, maintained that a tyrannous tyrant on a distant planet, froze unwanted souls into ice cubes, and threw them down a volcano on Earth. Perhaps there is no shortage of variations on this theme.
<p>
<b> The Original Gods. </b> In 2010 in the cave of St Denis, a Russian Orthodox saint, in Siberia, the remains of giants were found. They yielded readable DNA. Thus a race of ancient man was found who were cousins of the Neanderthals. They have been named the Denisovans. Thus it is now permissible in science to believe in Bigfoot, the Abominable Snowman, Sasquatch, the Nefilim and anyone else standing about 2.40 metres tall.
<p>
Now modern human giants are known to be on the weak side. Thus the actor who played the character Jaws in the James Bond films was no way near capable of performing his film feats of strength. This was not a problem to the film makers. Thus it is reasonable to believe that the giants of old were also weaker than ourselves. For optimum strength per kilo and a long life, 1.70 metres is a far better height.
<p>
In the Viking Sagas, Loki who becomes the mischief god is a Frost Giant. He talks his way into the family of Odin. If we read between the lines, then Loki may be a giant but does not have the physical strength to take on Odin's family. Thus he uses his wits and intelligence instead. Thus he becomes the archetype of impulse and fast talking. Loki also has a reputation as a shape changer, which could indicate he was an illusionist.
<p>
The Viking Sagas may give the best insight into the Denisovans. Meetings between Thor and the Frost Giants go through 5 phases.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thor meets a frost Giant.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is taken in by the illusion and delusions created by the frost Giant.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He breaks through the veil of illusion to see things as they actually are.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thor loses his temper.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thor kills the Frost Giant.
<p>
Aboriginal people like the Innuits or Eskimos, and the Australian Abos are very peaceful non violent people. They are not good at defending themselves. The aboriginal San people in South Africa were supposed to have been wiped out by the Zulus, to prevent them raiding Zulu cattle. However the modern Xhosa people claim to be the descendants of the San, and they control modern South African politics, not the Zulus!
<p>
In the Viking Sagas, the Frost Giants were experts in illusion and delusion, but could not match the strength of Thor. Thus we start to get a picture of sentient beings who preferred to use their intelligence and superior mental abilities like mind control, rather than physical strength.
<p>
The last version of Homo Sapiens to leave Africa is quite murderous. It has no qualms about wiping out inferior races like Abos, Jews and anyone of the wrong cult or religion. Violence is our great survival virtue.
<p>
<b> The Atlanteans, Nefilim, Elohim, Lemurians. </b> We could be looking at ancient civilisations which had more mental and mind control abilities than we have. Such a mental civilisation would not necessarily have written words or houses made of stone. With advanced remote viewing, they could have made the Maps of the Sea Kings. With advanced telepathy, they could have had an excellent communications system. The downside would have been remarkably little room for free will. Thus they would have left nothing that looks like a civilisation to us. As anyone who has dabbled in archeology knows, finds do tend to be miraculous exceptions anyway.
<p>
Atlantis and Lemuria are probably metaphors for things lost in history. They were probably not quite as described by Plato and others. There is no evidence for lost continents, but plenty of evidence for lost islands. We blame the Lemurians for the invention of astrology.
<p>
These lost civilisations were probably fine if one appreciated mind control, illusion, delusion, the acquired memory syndrome and astrology. We are probably happier without these things, with our TVs, houses and cars.
<p>
So what happened to these marvelous civilisations? We probably found them to be insufferable with their mind control and other vices. We probably did what we do best and killed them. We dispatched them in the style of Thor. In our guilt, we have turned them into Gods, remembering their virtues and not their vices. Perhaps smallpox and tuberculosis did the job for us. However the outcome is that we appear to be living in a Denisovan and Neanderthal created psychological universe.
<p>
Another possibility is that the Denisovans developed such a sophisticated psychic universe, that they destroyed themselves. They could not live in harmony with what they had created. Look out for Psychic Wars, and the Wars of the Gods. This begs the question, &quot;Can we survive the Communications Revolution (Radio, TV, the Internet)?&quot;.
<p>
In <a href="r12i.htm">Section M06.. </a>ETs and their activities - 2000, we suggested that in ET mythology, the Pleiadean ETs were supposed to escaped slaves from the reptilian Erideans. Now the Pleiadeans are supposed to be remarkably human like, and the females have large boobs, so the probability is that they originated from Earth. It could be hard luck on us if they are descendants of the Neanderthals or Denisovans, and not Homo Sapiens.
<p><b> Sidereal Energy. </b> Sidereal time is time relative to the stars. The Earth rotates apparently at approximately 365 times a year to give us approximately 365 days. However as the Earth rotates around the Sun, the real rotation is approximately 366 days per year. Thus Sidereal time is out of synchronicity with Earth time. There is a theory that psychic activity is greatest, when the point at which one is standing, is nearest to the Black Hole at the centre of our galaxy. Researchers such as JB Rhine found a very weak effect, while most scientists find none at all. It all depends on whose data one uses. It did not work for us when we tried it. However we now find that it appears to the force behind astrology. It is probably also the force that we thought was the Big Bang, in earlier articles. It now appears that schizophrenics can pick and store this energy, and then use it to produce charisma. However if they can not control this force properly, they end up with medical schizophrenia. Control it and you too can become Prime Minister.
<p>
<b> The Planets and other bodies in the Solar System as we found them.</b> This does not quite agree with retail astrology. Your own remote viewing will probable not quite agree with this list, but can be equally valid. There is also the problem that our views on astrology are themselves influenced by astrology. This is a system which underpins all Gods and religions.
<ul>
<li> <b>The Sun</b> - Energy, Life, living to the full.
<li> <b>Mercury</b> - Telepathy, Communication, Outward looking schizophrenia and the sale of dreams to other people. Good for politics.

<li> <b>The Earth</b> - Solid, and unteachable in occult matters (which may be a desirable thing)..
<li> <b>The Moon</b> - Lucid dreams and imagination under control, intuition.

<li> <b>Saturn</b> - Restrictive. Control, control, everything must be controlled (low risk). Risk / Reward analysis. Calculated risk.
<li> <b>Uranus</b> - Inward looking imagination and schizophrenia. Rebellion.
<li> <b>Neptune</b> - Skeptical, destructive, intolerance, intolerance of heresy and blasphemy, religion (including atheism) by the book, vampirism, a belief in reincarnation to atone for imaginary sins. The sins and games of God. The celibate homosexuality of monotheism.
<li> <b>Pluto</b> - Power by fair means or foul.Â 
<li> <b>Chiron</b> - Healing and also the sources of diseases that Chiron heals.
<li> <b>Ceres</b> - Nothing found.
<li> <b>Planet X or Nibiru</b> - Nothing found.
</ul>

<b> Conventional Science </b> states there are only 3 dimensions to the physical universe, plus time, and no more. If this is true, then in which dimensions are Dark Matter and Dark Energy, said to make up the bulk of the Universe.
<br><b> Quantum Physics</b> allows for 10 dimensions plus time. However the number of dimensions can vary according to the mathematics. Also 7 out of the 10 dimensions are alleged to have curled up and disappeared moments after the Big Bang. However if they have disappeared, then where are Dark Matter and Dark Energy situated.
<p>
We also suspect that UFOs are holographic projections by ETs, and are not as solid as they look. Distance in other dimensions may be a fraction of what they are in the dimensions we can observe. Thus an ET might be able to project a holographic UFO across 10 light years in our dimensions, with far less trouble, using dimensions we can not visualise. Such a UFO would have the agility normally claimed for UFOs. The downside would be that such a UFO would have limited interaction with us in the dimensions we know.
<p>
<b> The Lost Dimensions as accessed by the Reptilian Brain. </b> These can be the dimensions themselves, extensions to dimensions, add-ons, or may be human constructions imitating the dimensions. They may also be outward schizophrenic projections on to the Physical Universe. They may be a mixture of all of these, and not all of the same mixture. The only certainty is that they make little sense to the higher logical parts of the brain. The use of the lost dimensions acts as parking space for group memories and what ever. This enables the Universal Sub-conscious, Karma and Akasha to become realities. Some dimensions mentioned may be poetic licence on our part.
<p>
It appears we have gained in logic and imagination by becoming civilised. However we have lost in raw psychic ability. We also appear to have lost some abilities to clean up our psychic past.
<p>
<b> Top-Skimming. </b> One can go into depths psychoanalysing individuals, but that will only sort out individuals. Topskimming involves targeting the top of all hierarchies. This appears to give far better results, and can be far safer. If one removes the top of a hierarchy, then that hierarchy is weakened. We are hag ridden by the unfinished business of the dead. It is time to move forward.
