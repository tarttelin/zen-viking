<h1>Snippets from obsolete pages 1997.</h1>
</div>
<p>
<p> <b> THE RULES. </b> 
<ol> 
<li> Never fight an enemy using his rules. Minds have rules to protect their existence. Cheat like Hell.
<li> One is a spirit who at present has a body. 
<li> A person rises to their spiritual level of irresponsibility. (Peters' Principle is that a manager is promoted to his level of incompetence.) 
<li> Always do things as a series of small steps. That way things get done.
<li> Never do anything to other people that one would not do to oneself. What appears to be outside may also be part within. Enlightenment is a terrible weapon against those who not wish to be Enlightened.
<li> Everything one asks or commands others to do, one must be prepared to do oneself.
<li> No mind can exist without an entity to run it, in body or out.
<li> Always burn fossilised mind for energy, not one's own. If one experiences energy loss, one's methods are wrong. Energy deficits are normally corrected by using first party meditation, by restoring one's anger, or both.
<li> One cannot have what is not prepared to let others have. 
<li> &quot;This cannot possibly be true&quot;, is a statement of emotion, and the reverse may well be true. Be prepared to examine all reverse hypothesis. 
<li> The terms god, creator, source and controller are different aspects of the same thing. These are all functions of Zodiacs. God is best regarded as a courtesy title towards anything to which one wishes to be polite. 
<li> If one is not prepared to clean up their own God, who else is going to do it? If you are lucky, the CIA or MI5 may do it for you, but to their rules. 
</ol> 
<b> THE VIKING GODS. </b> The Sagas are a series of heroic stories written by shamans and leaders to define racial objectives and to give psychological and spiritual knowledge. The Vikings originated like most Western peoples from Mesopotamia. Religion is a function of climate, so that the cold of the North and the need for survival has knocked some uncommon sense into Viking. The Viking Gods are archetypal images that can be driven by anyone in the spirit world who wishes to help. A great deal of energy is invoked by those who use the archetypes. Such energy is a magnet for all Viking friendly spirit guides who are only too pleased to drive the archetypes from the other side, to impart inspiration and knowledge. However you have to do the work. This is similar to Spiritualists using Red Indian images to communicate with the other side.
<p>
<b>THE PROBLEM WITH CONTROL </b>is that it is bound up with godship.
<ul>
<li> Spirit is there but there is no sign of a Universal Deity.
<li> Guides at spiritualist meetings do not confirm the existence of any God. 
<li> If a man is castrated he reverts to female form, but a woman remains female. The natural form of Spirit is passive and therefore female. There are plenty of Goddesses to be found at this level but no Gods.
<li> A spiritualist's guide is hardly likely to say &quot;I am your spirit guide, Big Chief Sitting Bull. I am a Goddess&quot;.
<li> Thus male Gods appear to be of man made creation.
<li> Goddess appears to be a highly acceptable title for spirit. There appear to be goddesses in charge of just about every subject possible, the good, the bad and the revolting.
<li> The truth about God looks as if people look around the telepathic net to find the most enlightened being, and freeload on him for inspiration. In the meantime the priest defines the attributes of this God (or sucker), and takes the credit. In this conspiracy the sucker must not get any credit. When the sucker is overloaded and worn out, people discard him and look for a new sucker.
<li> It can appear to be great fun taking over the control of all and sundry. However if one is only half able to control, all that happens is that people relink their minds into yours and download their minds. They will use you as God and create an overload.
<li> If one is not prepared to control others then they tend to control you, and dig their claws in.
<li> Total personal control and total personal mastery must be kept clean at all times, even if this is only to keep zodiacs at bay. No amount of psychic self defence and personal survival can compensate for lack of control. 
<li> Control of other people is not necessary and can be detrimental to karma if used wrongly. The ability to control is necessary.
</ul>
<p>
SPIRIT COMMUNICATION seems to follow similar rules to ordinary verbal communication. However there are some changes in emphasis which make it look different. 
<ul>
<li> TERMINALS. Any entity or thing is a terminal for the purposes of communication. Objects in the physical world can be expected to be very inactive.
<p>
<li> LINKS are needed by Spirit to other terminals for communication. One thing which comes out of remote viewing is that Spirit does not recognise the 3 dimensions, or time past or present. There are no time lags in remote viewing regardless of the light year distance involved. Spirit is everywhere and nowhere. What it does do is to establish links into other things and entities. There is either a link or no link. Links can be via second, third and fourth parties. Links can be into light, the Aether or the Fires of Purgatory. This is a complete contradiction of all normal sane 4 dimensional logic.
<p> 
<li> SATELLITE TERMINALS are created by black magicians to bring other entities under their control. This can be regarded as a hard link, whereas all links should be dynamic.
<p>
<li> NETWORKS can exist of master terminals and satellites, the satellites becoming masters of lesser satellites. These are hierarchical networks. Networks should be dynamic, and in the form of a matrix where any terminal communicates to any other relevant terminal. 
<p>
<li> CHANNELS are needed to direct communication to a target or other end of the link, otherwise communications can get lost in infinity. These can be visualised as fenced paths that one can travel down, send messages along or receive messages back. Copper wire makes a poor substitute as it is hard to visualise travelling down a copper wire. Channels like links can be to anywhere in the physical universe regardless of light years, or to anywhere in any non physical universe or any dimension.
<p> 
<li> A FLOW is what one sends down a channel to a target, and may appear to be part of oneself. A flow can be any emotion. It can also be one of the Akashic elements, Fire, Air, Water or Earth. There is also the crazy Zen Flow which is part Fire and part Air. 
<p>
<li> A PROJECTION is a concept or picture that one wishes to send to the target. A projection is a statement of intention. If the target ignores it even subconsciously, then it fails to arrive. If it arrives, then there should be some response and it will be returned in an altered form. This can the start of 2 way communication. If it comes back in reversed form, then this can be distressing to the sender. This is the case where a black magician sends you malice, and you convert it into responsibility for his actions. Similarly if one sends someone healing and it is returned as malice, then retaliation in the form of sending responsibility is called for. Projections of Fire and the crazy Zen flow may be implied by the cleaning nature of these flows.
<p>
<li> TIME. One is unlikely to get a reply before the message is sent. There can be considerable time delays in the target responding. A projection may be stored and not handled till much later. The objective of the black magician is for the message to be stored and never handled. The responsibility levels of sender and target play a large part in this. 
</ul>
FREE, ORGONE, REIKI AND ZERO-POINT ENERGY may all be more similar than they first appear. Zero-point energy is the physical type that may one day drive your car, oil barons and bankers permitting. They all come from the Aether, the void that fills Space and cannot possibly exist under the Laws of Einstein. The Aether cannot exist under the Laws of any Theology or it is God. These energies exist regardless of whether one believes in them or not. However it is possible that zero-point energy will only work if one believes in it and allows it to work. Thus if all the cars in the country ran on zero-point energy, half of them would not start first thing on a Monday morning.
<p>
There is plenty of energy, knowledge and other things to be had free of charge from the Aether. That is provided one can kick out all the priests, scientists and bankers who wish to charge you for its use. 
<p>
THE TELEPATHIC NET. Most readers will be conversant with the Internet. There is also a telepathic net or network with many variations and plenty of mass. This is a linkup of telepathic entities with bodies or without. Every entity has a mind so the net is not clean.
<p>
META LANGUAGES AND CODES. Codes can exist at many levels. A few are listed below.
<ul>
<li> Computer login codes, nicknames, pseudonyms, and acronyms like ESP. It often pays to know what a code originally referred to. 
<li> Name, rank and number are the hallmarks of a system, its slaves and possessions.
<li> All languages are made up of codes. Any message is made up of a string of codes. A conscious body may not be able to understand the basic or meta languages of Spirit, minds, bodies and even genes. This is a fault in human consciousness. Meta languages can be cleaned up. This opens up the way into many very basic areas. If intention is good and the appropriate meta language is clean, the unconscious mind can do the automatic translation.
<li> All telepathy is Spirit to Spirit communication and is in the form of Meta Language, which is not understandable to bodies or the writer. Translation is automatic. 
</ul>

<div align=center> 
<b> Harmonics and Dynamics. </b> 
</div>
<p>
HARMONY is a state of order, agreement or completeness in the relation of things, or of parts of a whole to each other (Webster). Harmony is passive. Harmony is made up of harmonics.
<ul>
<li> When 2 sounds of pure frequency have a mathematical relationship to each other, they are called harmonics of each other.
<li> Not all harmonics are harmonious. The seventh harmonic in music is discordant. Thus remarkably few 7 cylinder ships' diesel engines have ever been produced, and those that have have been regarded as unfortunate.
<li> Harmony is not limited to sound. Two things may be in harmony with each other, such as when a place location and the speed of light have a mathematical relationship to each other, involving whole numbers and natural constants like Pi (radius of a circle / circumference), or Phi (Golden Mean). Bruce Cathie is the public expert on this type of mathematics.
<li> Left to its own devices, any system will revert to harmony.
<li> It is best if past, present and future are in harmony with each other.
<li> Harmony will always tend towards no action and can therefore be a dead end. 
</ul>
DYNAMICS pertain to forces not in equilibrium, or to motion as the result of force (Webster). Thus real dynamics cannot be static or passive. Dynamics involve force and energy.
<ul>
<li> Force and energy disturb harmony. This is not a problem if the system is allowed to revert to harmony after the event. The new harmony need not be the same as the previous one.
<li> Dynamics allow for change to suit new requirements. 
<li> Organised religions are systems designed to permanently distort harmony. Political systems may not be much better, but at least we have elections.
<li> All zodiacs, minds, systems of slavery and mind control are fossilised dynamics that violate harmony.
<li> To prevent discord, all dynamics must be dismantled after use.
<li> There cannot be change without a dynamic. 
</ul>
RESONANCE.
<ul>
<li> When 2 things are in harmony with each other, they will pick up the harmonics of each other. 
<li> Some resonances can be unfortunate. Most people do not want to resonate with death.
</ul>
UNIVERSAL SUBCONSCIOUS and PERSONAL SUBCONSCIOUS. If these are kept clean, then they will work automatically for one and let one get on with more important things.
<p>
SATAN or DEVIL is the name normally given to a politically incorrect God. Who has the right to decide what is politically correct for other people? Let the Devil take the lot. Political correctness is mind control for those lacking in personal responsibility.
<p>
DARK ANGELS are entities who have lived on Earth. They are not enlightened enough to choose their own destiny. They fear reincarnation as then they would become victims of their own karma. They avoid reincarnation by shedding their karma on to the living. Farming the peculiar energy of Multiple Sclerosis sufferers is a great aid to them. They tend to use the identities of higher beings like the Elohim or Nordic ETs. They have strong links into the Acquired Memory Syndrome, MS, farming (cf vampirism), manufactured Gods, golems and secret societies. They will love you to death. They are sick and revolting. 
<p>
THE ACQUIRED KNOWLEDGE SYNDROME is similar to the acquired memory syndrome. Knowledge of how a computer chip works is instantly forgettable, but people know where to find it again if necessary. Knowledge is only useful if one can use it and make it one's own. Most religious and occult knowledge fails the test of having any practical use. Then there is the knowledge given by spirit guides which may or may not have any use. Then there is the knowledge given by Dark Angels, especially to secret lodges. Most of this has to be stripped away if one wants real ability. Ultimately enlightenment and spiritual knowledge are of little significance, but personal responsibility is everything.
<p>
ANGEL is a general term for Spirit as viewed by a body. The Dark Angels mentioned above are without body, but most people have a Spirit attached and this is the type described here. Dion Fortune reckoned that she had met some bodies without Spirit who had &quot;The morality of the farm yard&quot;. Decide which angels are required and add them to one's list of subjects. Spirit is one or many, and does not follow the same rules of identity as say bodies. Thus Spirit as one is God, as one of many is your Guardian Angel, and for the Gods of any religion is somewhere inbetween. 
<ul>
<li> Guardian Angels are Spirit acting on behalf of the body.
<li> Dark Angels are a level higher and do their own thing.
<li> Angels of Light have evolved above dark angels.
<li> Going for the high ground, look at Angels of Ability. There should be an angel for every aspect that one wishes to clean up. Thus one can have Psi and Psychic Angels that are the various faces of Spirit. On the healing side one can clean up Healing Angels and Angels of Rejuvenation for oneself, Angels that can cure MS for friends, and Psychiatric Angels and Angels of Total Personal Responsibility for intelligence agencies. One may only gain small percentages, but small percentages add up.
<li> Spirit. All angels are various aspects of Spirit at various levels of emotion, enlightenment and responsibility. 
</ul>

<b> Restoring Harmonic Order out of Chaos.</b> 
</div>
<p>
Restoring harmonic order out of chaos would not be needed, if ETs, mind controllers, priests, and clever theologians had not been imposing artificial order to suit their own requirements. Zero is a point where we are nothing, do nothing and have nothing. From Zero, we can reach out and do what we wish, and return to Zero when we wish. Minds are some thing and therefore have a hard time existing in Zero. Minds are blockages in flows. The range of types of flows and minds is only limited by one's imagination. When a woman sends a man her love, she is sending a flow. When a man answers such a flow with action and protection, he is sending a flow back. Remote psychotherapy runs on such flows. Spirit is one or many, and does not follow the same rules of identity as say bodies. Thus Spirit as one is God, and as one of many is your Guardian Angel. He who owns Spirit, owns all mind control, perverse influences and discordant flows. Natural order in the Galaxy runs on:-
<ul>
<li> Zero.
<li> Flows.
<li> Harmonics.
<li> Discords (and blockages).
<li> Balance.
<li>
<li> Dynamics. (One's own mind should be dynamic to be created and destroyed at will.)
<li> Statics. (Minds imposed on one.)
</ul>
FLOWS can be categorised under at least 3 dualities.
<ul>
<li> Output flows.
<li> Input flows. One mind control trick is to block beneficial flows and only allow malignant ones.
<li> 
<li> Attractor flows. Eg. Love for which the male response is to produce protection and defence flows for the female. Friendship and affinity flows are bisexual.
<li> Attacker flows. Eg. Defence flows. 
<li> 
<li> Positive flows are flows above Anger and can integrate body, mind and Spirit and just about anything else. 
<ul>
<li> Integration flows can integrate everything available. 
<li> Harmonising flows will harmonise everything available. 
<li> Disintegration flows will destroy unwanted rubbish and allow one to return to Zero. For minds to exist, disintegration flows must be blocked at all costs. 
</ul>
<li> Negative flows are below Anger and give away energy to one's vampire owners. <ul>
<li> Sacrificial flows. Love, healing and creativity can be sacrificial flows if there is not enough responsibility and anger around to prevent them from being sacrificial. Sacrificial flows are a case of giving away more than is healthy. 
<li> Negative Disintegration flows are necessary for successful brainwashing and mind control. Break the victim down first, and then give him a new acquired mind.
<li> Ownership flows are from the successful mind controller to his victim.
</ul>
<li>
<li> Specific flows may be associated with people or come from outside. These include the Crazy Zen flow which is a thought breaker, Responsibility, Anger, Fire, Energy, Psi, Physical Telekinesis and Action flows.
<li> Mind control flows include Discordant flows, Perverse flows, etc.
</ul>
OWNERSHIP. The great original mind control trick is for a mind to gain ownership of Spirit. Spirit always returns to Zero and Harmony when unhindered. Being owned by a mind blocks this. Minds then tell you that they are &quot;Creating order out of Chaos&quot; which is a lie.
<p>
<div align=center>
<b> Vampires.</b> 
</div>
<p>
VAMPIRISM, PROFIT and LOSS. There is a lot of vampirism at the heart of current mentalism, with a chain of vampirism coming down via ETs. What is the point of going for psi, if any energy produced is going to be vampired. All the vampires on Earth are the height of respectability and half of them are priests. Anyone trying to name and shame this lot will fall foul of the Establishment, scientific establishment, orthodox religion, the British Blasphemy Act, the Race Relations Act, any act covering freedom of religion, and the ethnic propaganda machines. They all want you to be good little peasants, even if they get caught in their own trap.
<p>
A VAMPIRE in literature is a being who can live for ever living on your blood. There are a number of immortals who remain stuck in one game by sucking your energy. There are reports of entities who have died, but fearing reincarnation try to put off the evil day by vampiring the living. They may have bodies of some sort or other. Followers of Zecharia Sitchin will not have far to look. A body may take many forms and could be such a thing as a zodiac or an Astral Body. Reincarnation applies to games as much as bodies. In a dynamic environment, everything should be recycled, including gods and games. 
<p> 
There is nothing for it to fight fire with fire and vampire the vampires. The procedure below may be rather short lived, and one will have to change &quot;Vampire&quot; back to &quot;Destroy&quot;. Vampirism will run out when we have total control of vampirism. Only try vampiring those who are trying to vampire you. Trying to vampire friends and associates will make one as popular as a Jew. Find out who is currently vampiring who. If anything is fossilised or comes from the past, it can not be dynamic and should be purged.
<p>
FAIR TRADE. If one exchanges excess energy or energy one does not want for goods and services one does want, that is fair trade. If one gives up energy one does want, that is vampirism. What is fair trade is largely in the eye of the beholder. If there were no profit in it, there would be no point in anyone maintaining obsolete mental systems.
<p>
<hr>
<p> 
<div align=center>
<b> The Creation of Psi.</b> 
</div>
<p>
A body can not create psi. A Spirit can if it feels like it and it is safe to do so. What a body can do is to help knock out the blockages. Consider the following.
<ul>
<li> Psi was beaten up by some creator and has not yet recovered.
<li> Psi was extensively used in some original creation, and must be suppressed by the Creator to prevent the universes being unraveled.
<li> Psi is constantly bullied by memes, minds and Gods from the Psychological Universe.
<li> You beat up psi when the horse you have backed fails to win the race. Psi is retributed against whenever requests for psi fail. Reasons for failure include - 
<ul>
<li> Making improper requests.
<li> Requests which can not be serviced.
<li> Failure to recognise the proper answer.
<li> Asking a mental entity or meme, mistaking it for psi.
<li> It is unsafe to do anything.
<li> The body or the environment may not be suitable for the resulting action.
<li> Psi is too weak.
</ul>
<li> Blockages are caused by psychological Gods, minds, memes, owners, etc, who must be cleared out of the way. One must also clear the responsibilities to these entities.
<li> Psi is desperate for love and healing. Psi is also desperately short of responsibility to itself and to the Spirit or Morphic World.
<li> Psi Energy could be the most powerful energy available, once rejuvenated, but is currently swamped out by gross mental energy.
<li> Psi Energy destroys all psychological Gods, memes and minds, probably because it takes out the psi component.
<li> You have the choice, Psi Energy or psychological Gods, memes and minds. One can only have negative psi with spirituality. What price spirituality?
<li> Psi Energy can express itself in many ways, a few of which may be recognisable to a body.
</ul>
