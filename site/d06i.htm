<h3> S06. Using Psi Lists. </h3> 
</div> 
<p> USING PSI LISTS.
<ul> 
<li> Command lists using Psi or Location in Space / Time work well for anything with an emotional level of Boredom / Enlightenment upwards. 
<li> Responsibility command lists in this book work very well for everything with an emotional level of Anger, Control and below.
<li> <b> As a result, one has to use psi command lists with other ones. </b> One has to learn how to switch quickly when one is using the wrong type.
<li> Without using both types, one is liable to bogged down in a psi mind. 
<li> This section tends to work on clearing logical minds of rubbish, but does not give real psi in the physical universe. 
<li> While this section is not good at producing psi in the physical universe, it does help fill the Emptiness of Spirit in a positive way. This helps to prevent old mental rubbish from returning.
<li> There is so much negative energy and psi around that any little helps to reduce the negative stuff. This is even if there is no observable change in one's abilities.
</ul>
REASONS FOR ABSENCE OF REAL PSI.
<ul>
<li> There is too much negative psi around for positive psi to be evident. 
<li> One does not have the necessary genes.
<li> Psi is excluded by one's current Zodiac. Excluded universes cannot be handled by normal meditation.
<li> Psi is a function of Spirit or possibly animal Spirit and not of minds.
<li> There are too many so called higher entities which have laid a claim to own your psi abilities. Using responsibility on psi will decrease it. One can however target the &quot;Owners of Psi&quot;, etc.
<li> Like communication, telepathy should be 2 way. This probably applies to every other psi ability. There are War Memes which when they land dictate what one should receive telepathically and what one should reject. In a similar manner these memes control what one can telepath to other people. When ever we hear the words &quot;Holy&quot;, &quot;Spiritual&quot;, &quot;Immortal Soul&quot;, &quot;Thetan&quot;, we normally suspect war or control memes and are not usually disappointed. 
</ul>
POSITIVE and NEGATIVE PSI. 
<ul>
<li> There is negative psi used for mind control. 
<li> There is positive psi which is the type most people want for themselves.
<li> Say what you mean and mean what you say. Otherwise one is liable to get the wrong type.
<li> The positive psi of most people is either owned by their vampires and mind controllers, or is tied up in fighting negative psi.
<li> Positive psi is needed to fill the &quot;Emptiness of Spirit&quot; as one removes old rubbish. Otherwise new negative psi will rush in to take the place of that dispatched.
</ul>
Psi is a natural function of Spirit, and thus cannot be meditated on using mental methods, as is not a function of mind. It does however gather a lot of mental rubbish like moral codes. There is such a thing as removing the negative influences, and that is what a psi command list will do. The psi mind is higher than the logical mind, but does not contain any logic. Thus it is difficult to write about it. Most knowledge depends on logic, and so any knowledge of how to do psi is most likely false knowledge or know-all ignorance. Treat psi as a natural ability of Spirit. It appears that in the past, we have given away our psi abilities to others in a similar way to the way we gave away our responsibility. We can try to get it back.
<p> 
Do not expect dramatic psychic results, and be prepared to be grateful for any small gifts. The writer has had few psychic results that he would accept as proof in other people. However life is made up of small percentages, and any such gift however small is worth receiving.
<p> 
No mind can produce psi, but no mind can admit this. Therefore if one commands the mind to produce psi, it burns itself up in the effort. It is commanding the mind to do the impossible, which is all good Zen. The great advantage of psi command lists, is that they keep one pointed in the right direction. They are useful when one has lost one's way. <i> To Spirit they are great fun. </i> 
<p> 
PSI ABILITY LIST. The following is a command list for psychic ability. Everyone knows of psychic abilities they would not touch with a barge pole. The writer will not touch trance mediumship, and regards clairvoyance as a spectator sport only. The list is far too long, so cut it down drastically. Reorder it with the most important abilities to the reader first. Then start adding one's own, so that it becomes a personal list.
<ul> 
<li> I will do.
<li> I will psi.
<li> I will ESP.
<li> I will physically telekine. (Telekinesis.)
<li> I will psychic surgery. 
<li> I will predict the national lottery.
<li> I will out of body view the future.
<li> I will remotely view.
<li> I will remote influence.
<li> I will remote psychotherapy.
<li> I will remote physiotherapy.
<li> I will levitate.
<li> I will teleport.
<li> I will medium.
<li> I will clairvoyance.
<li> I will clairaudience.
<li> I will predict the future.
<li> I will heal.
<li> I will cure disease.
<li> I will telepath.
<li> I will operate outside the body.
<li> I will operate on the Astral Planes.
<li> I will create 2 way telepathy, psi, etc.
</ul> 
SUBJECTS FOR REMOTE MEDITATION. Replace &quot;I&quot; with any of the following.
<ul> 
<li> Any item mentioned in this site.
<li> Any attribute of body, mind and Spirit.
<li> This section is not suitable for dealing with enemies, until one is of a forgiving and forgetting nature.
<li> Any psi or any other ability.
<li> The brain as a sensory organ.
<li> Everything, Everybody, Everyone, the Sins of Spirit, Every Member of Spirit, We, I.
<li> Every member of the body, body consciousness and the needs of the body.
</ul> 
HAZARDS.
<ol> 
<li> If one tries remotely viewing the future, then one has to take responsibility for one's next existence. However this is a good way of bypassing karma and avoiding one's just deserts.
<li> There are certain key words in the Zodiac like <i> winning. </i> These have to be located by trial and error. What they do is to unduly dig one in.
</ol> 
A FRONT END FOR CHOICE. Very often one can get abreaction on doing, without knowing which command list is appropriate. Try the following and break out into the appropriate command list when one gets abreaction. The list is top down for getting one outside the mind and into the real world.
<ul> 
<li> I will do.
<li> I will psi.
<li> I will ESP.
<li> I will locate points in space.
<li> I will locate points in time.
<li> I will physically telekine.
<li> I will psychic surgery. 
<li> I will be totally awake.
<li> I will be totally responsible for my existence.
</ul> 
KEEPING PSI CLEAN. The following is good for cleaning purposes and when other forms do not work. Turn the whole list around into third party form.
<ul> 
<li> Every owner of Action will do.
<li> Every owner of Psi will do.
<li> Every owner of ESP will do, etc.
<li>
<li> Every owner of positive psi.
<li> Every owner of positive ESP.
<li> Every owner of negative psi.
<li> Every owner of negative ESP.
<li>
<li> Every enemy of psi will do, etc. 
<li> Every owner of psi games will do, etc.
</ul>
BODY PSI FLOWS. One can dabble in the following with other command lists to see what results come up.
<ul>
<li> Every owner of body psi.
<li> Every owner of body ESP.
<li> Every owner of body telepathy.
</ul> 
<p>
USING TABLES OF EMOTION. When using tables of emotion include death and boredom, as it is very easy to stick on these without realising it. As serenity is a do nothing emotion, it can have a negative effect on health. 
<p>
SIDEREAL TIME. Joe McMoneagle states that at 13.47 hours local sidereal time, which James Spottiswoode reports as the optimum time for psi, one is facing into the centre of the Milky Way which is probably the centre of the galaxy. There appears to be something there. Find out who owns the Galaxy. Sidereal time is based on a 366.25 day year which is the number of times the Earth spins in a year and not the apparent number of days. Base date is March 21st, the start of the House of Aries. Local sidereal time is sidereal time adjusted by longitude or distance from longitude zero in terms of degrees. Sidereal time appears to make no difference to the writer, possibly because there are various kinds of psi.
<p>
<b> Spirit Psi as opposed to body Psi is heavily into Spirit to Spirit Communication. </b>

<p>
<b> Mind Control </b> is a subject which often comes up in discussion on psi. However mind control is liable to trap the student back into Akasha. Also if one is going to dabble, then control of other people's bodies and reptilian brains may be far more effective.
