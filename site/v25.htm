<h3>2.5. RESPONSIBILITY - THE KEY TO THE UNIVERSE. </h3>
</div>
<p>2.5.1.1. RESPONSIBILITY - THE ULTIMATE KEY TO THE UNIVERSE. Responsibility
does have at least nine attributes. These will be given with appropriate command
lists, suitable to the top level. These lists will have to be varied to suit the
level at which the student is working. Conscious walking is essential. The
attributes are:-
</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>Responsibility for in real time. No problem.
</li>
<li>Responsibility to in real time. No problem.
</li>
<li>Personal responsibility for in past time.
</li>
<li>Personal responsibility to in past time.
</li>
<li>Commanding third parties to take responsibility for their actions.
</li>
<li>Reversing responsibility to third parties, to responsibility to self.
</li>
<li>The need to keep responsibility free of rubbish.
</li>
<li>If one fails to create enough, then responsibility becomes a liability.
See Black Holes.
</li>
<li>Ultimately one will no longer need responsibility, and it will have to be
dispatched.
</li></ol>
<p>2.5.1.2. RESPONSIBILITY FOR AND TO - IN REAL TIME. When people drive a car,
they grant their responsibility to other road users. This is for the results of
their actions, until they park their car on their own property. This is in real
time, and is no problem. It allows people to drive their cars in reasonable
safety. When the car is properly parked, people withdraw their responsibility.
Before people can be responsible for something, they must be responsible to
someone or something. In this case, people should know what they are responsible
for. They should also know to whom they are granting their responsibility. If
they do not grant responsibility to other road users, then the Police will apply
the law.
</p>
<p>2.5.1.3. RESPONSIBILITY FOR - IN PAST TIME. When the situation is in the
past, then for meditational purposes there are two aspects. A person can command
responsibility for themselves. A person can also command someone or something
else to take responsibility for their actions. For third party responsibility to
work, the other party must be linked in to the first party.  The third party
must have their claws dug into the first party. Thus it is practically
impossible to harm an innocent bystander.
</p>
<p>2.5.1.4. RESPONSIBILITY TO - IN PAST TIME. For responsibility to exist in
past time, responsibility must have been granted to someone or something. The
normal case is that a person has forgotten to whom they granted their
responsibility to in the first place. Responsibility for and to have become
fossilised. There are two methods of attack in meditation. One can grant their
responsibility in real time to all appropriate entities. Bringing it into real
time is great for cooling things down. It is difficult to command other
entities, if one is responsible to them. The other option is to re-link the
responsibility of the other entity back to oneself. It will not last long in
real time.
</p>
<p>2.5.2. RESPONSIBILITY FOR - FIRST PARTY
</p>
<ul>
<li>I am totally awake / I do.
</li>
<li>I am totally responsible for my existence.
</li>
<li>I am totally responsible for my objectives.
</li>
<li>I am totally responsible for my actions.
</li>
<li>I am totally responsible to myself.
</li>
<li>I am totally responsible for pain.
</li>
<li>I am totally responsible for unconsciousness.
</li>
<li>I am totally responsible for all mass / sewerage.
</li></ul>
<p>The command lists given here are in three sections. There is a start to
establish the tool or weapon. The gap in the middle is for the student to insert
items of immediate interest. The end is to clean out all rubbish. If the going
is heavy, omit the middle.
</p>
<p>Other subjects:-
</p>
<ul>
<li>Everything, Everybody, Everyone, We, I.</li></ul>
<p>2.5.3. RESPONSIBILITY TO (the Cooler).
</p>
<ul>
<li>I am totally awake / I do.
</li>
<li>I am totally responsible to my existence.
</li>
<li>I am totally responsible to my objectives.
</li>
<li>I am totally responsible to my actions.
</li>
<li>I am totally responsible to myself.
</li>
<li>I am totally responsible to all Gods.
</li>
<li>I am totally responsible to all psyches.
</li>
<li>I am totally responsible to all egos.
</li>
<li>I am totally responsible to all animal spirits
</li>
<li>I am totally responsible to all bodies.
</li>
<li>I am totally responsible to all pain.
</li>
<li>I am totally responsible to all unconsciousness.
</li>
<li>I am totally responsible to all mass / sewerage.
</li></ul>
<p>The above is bad for the Ego. It does however show up some surprising
linkages. It is great for cooling all Fire flows.
</p>
<p>2.5.4. RESPONSIBILITY FOR - THIRD PARTY. This can be used when the
abreaction in first party responsibility is drained. It is unlikely to work
before that. The basic idea is to command other entities to take responsibility
for their actions. They will not like it.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Let everything be totally awake.
</li>
<li>Let everything be totally responsible for its existence.
</li>
<li>Let everything be totally responsible for its actions.
</li>
<li>Let everything be totally responsible for its objectives.
</li>
<li>Let everything be totally responsible to me.
</li>
<li>Let everything be totally responsible for its pain.
</li>
<li>Let everything be totally responsible for its unconsciousness.
</li>
<li>Let everything be totally responsible for its mass.
</li></ul>
<p>2.5.4.1 AUTHORISATION. The whole mind works on authorisation mechanisms.
Below are some useful additions. If the body can see it, so can everything else.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Let everything work for mutual profit and reward.
</li>
<li>Let everything authorise the body to see it.
</li>
<li>Let everything authorise the body to use it.
</li></ul>
<p>Other subjects include:-
</p>
<ul>
<li>Responsibility (to keep it clean).
</li>
<li>Body, Ego, Psyche, Spirit, the Gods.
</li>
<li>Any attribute listed in this book, including the obstacle course.
</li>
<li>Creation, Uncreation.
</li>
<li>Everything, Everybody, Everyone, We.
</li>
<li>The Universal Subconscious.
</li>
<li>The Big Bang.
</li>
<li>The British Blasphemy Act.
</li></ul>
<p>2.5.5. RE-LINK RESPONSIBILITY. In practice, the following command list is
practically impossible to run. It tends to instantly show up all gaps in current
first and third party responsibility.
</p>
<ul>
<li>I do.
</li>
<li>I am totally responsible for my existence.
</li>
<li>I am totally responsible for my actions.
</li>
<li>I am totally responsible to myself.
</li>
<li>Let the body be totally responsible to me.
</li>
<li>Let all animal spirits be totally responsible to me.
</li>
<li>Let all egos be totally responsible to me.
</li>
<li>Let all psyches be totally responsible to me.
</li>
<li>Let all spirits be totally responsible to me.
</li>
<li>Let all Gods be totally responsible to me.
</li>
<li>Let everything be totally responsible to me.
</li>
<li>Let everybody be totally responsible to me.
</li>
<li>Let everyone be totally responsible to me.
</li></ul>
<p><b>2.5.6. SOME USEFUL VARIATIONS.</b></p>
<p>2.5.6.1. TO INCREASE INTENTION, project the sweeper into the future. Drop
this form if it has too many teeth. Try variations on the following:-
</p>
<ul>
<li>I will do.
</li>
<li>I will be responsible for my actions. Etc.
</li>
<li></li>
<li>Everything will do.
</li>
<li>Everything will be responsible for its actions. Etc.
</li></ul>
<p>2.5.6.2. RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE RESULTS OF ONE'S ACTIONS. There is a
distinct difference between being responsible for one's actions, and being
responsible for the results of one's actions. For the latter, try variations on
the following:-
</p>
<ul>
<li>I will do.
</li>
<li>I will be totally responsible for the results of my existence.
</li>
<li>I will be totally responsible for the results of my objectives.
</li>
<li>I will be totally responsible for the results of my actions. Etc.
</li></ul>
<p>2.5.6.3. THE NEXT UNIVERSE UP. A good way of catching this is to prefix
third party commands with &quot;Universal&quot;.
</p>
<ul>
<li>The Universal Subconscious will do.
</li>
<li>The Universal God will do.
</li>
<li>The Universal will do.
</li>
<li>The next universe up will do. Etc.
</li></ul>
<h3>2.5.7 RESPONSIBILITY AND ITS CAUSES.</h3>
<p>2.5.7.1. All minds are made up of responsibility to. In times past, we have
made treaties and agreements with each other as to how we should conduct
ourselves in relation to others. We have given our responsibility to these
agreements which have become moral codes. These moral codes have been broken
left, right and centre, if only to a small degree but small degrees add up. We
have forgotten to what the last moral code was a response. Thus all minds are
made up of all old responsibilities to agreements, 'forgotten', and mangled by
self justification into something which looks quite different, like a mind or a
theology or a mental system.
</p>
<p>2.5.7.2. Past responsibilities have been given to the following. There is
nothing wrong in any of these as long as they are in real time.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Loyalties and allegiances.
</li>
<li>One's goals and objectives.
</li>
<li>Treaties, agreements and moral codes.
</li>
<li>Minds and gods, each of whom has a rule book. Each rule book is made up of
rules.
</li></ul>
<p>2.5.7.3. In order to get out of minds altogether, try locating oneself in
space time.
</p>
<ul>
<li>I will do.
</li>
<li>I will locate points in space.
</li>
<li>I will locate points in time.
</li>
<li>I will locate points in the physical universe.
</li>
<li>I will locate objects in the physical universe.
</li>
<li>I will locate myself in space.
</li>
<li>I will locate myself in real time.
</li>
<li>I will locate myself in the physical universe.
</li></ul>
<p>Other important subjects are:-
</p>
<ul>
<li>Every responsibility, loyalty, allegiance, objective, mind, moral code or
rule book, and rule.
</li>
<li>Everything, everybody, everyone, we.
</li>
<li>E.g. Every responsibility will do.
</li></ul>
<p><b>2.5.8.1. A STRONGER VERSION.</b> When the ego and all entities within are
responsible for their actions, the sweepers in this section will not work, and
it is time to leave this section behind. However the following front end is
useful when low material comes in from the genuine outside.
</p>
<ul>
<li>I will do.
</li>
<li>I will be totally awake.
</li>
<li>I will take total personal responsibility for my existence.
</li>
<li>I will take total personal responsibility for my actions.
</li>
<li>I will take total personal responsibility for my realities.
</li>
<li>I will take total personal responsibility for my moral codes.
</li>
<li>I will take total personal responsibility for my objectives.
</li>
<li>(Add in a middle and end as appropriate.)
</li></ul>
<p><b>2.5.8.2. A USEFUL CHECKLIST OF SUBJECTS:-</b>
<ul>
<li>Every responsibility, loyalty, allegiance, mind, moral code, morality, rule book, rule, reality, objective.
</li>
<li>Everything, everybody, everyone, we, I.
</li>
</ul>
