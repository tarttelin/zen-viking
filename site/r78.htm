<b> Astrology.</b> Our views have not much changed since 1997 when we wrote <a href="http://www.viking-z.org/d03j.htm">S03. Some Simple Drills.. </a> Astrology contains houses and planets which contain zodiacs which contain goals in various fractal patterns. Goals are there by the thousand and too many to handle individually. Goals are still in 6 states, positive and negative, present, future and past. As astrology is dependent on the plan of this planet, this solar system and how astronomy appears from Earth, it appears to have originated on Earth. It appears devoid of logic. It appears to be understandable to the primitive reptilian brain, but not the conscious mind. It is highly suited to a society of clones to give variation, but we have genetics to give us variation. It has little effect on the individual, unless they want it to apply to us. It has a far greater effect on populations.
<p>
Scientists claim that in the Big Bang, mathematical constants were created which are just right for human life on this planet. If the mathematics had been any different, we would not exist, and this might apply to the universe as well. This suggests a self adjusting system which can balance itself.
<p>
Astrology appears to be a self balancing and adjusting system which created itself with a bit of help from the Denisovans, our genetics and the history of man and his Karma. This does not prevent us from uncreating it. The Machinery of the Universe appears to be built on Astrology.
<p>
<b> Schizophrenia </b> starts to appear as an unfortunate combination of genetics and astrology, unsuited and unadapted to current requirements. When it is introverted it can land one in hospital. When extroverted it can become the dreaded psychic plague which upsets everyone in contact. We can not change our genes, but we can learn to live with the advantages and disadvantages of what we have got.
<br>
Schizophrenia may also predate astrology, and have some part in its creation.
<ul>
<li> Target My / Our / Every Goal / Zodiac / Astrology / House / Planet / Schizophrenia.
<li> The graves of every astrologer / schizophrenic, the graves on every planet.
</ul>
<p>
<b> Morphic Fields. </b>
<br> All are very dependent on telepathy. All can be cleaned up.
<ul>
<li> The Psychology of the Sub-conscious Mind.
<li> Charisma, Psychotherapy, Healing.
<li> Remote Viewing.
<li> Conventional Science. (Should be neutral.)
<li> Psychic Warfare.
<li> Mind Control.
<li> Religions. (Incapable of change.)
<li> Totalitarian Regimes. (Third Reich, Communism, etc.)
<li> Telekinesis (real or psychological).
<li> Poltergeist Activity.
<li> Psychic Plague.
<li> Apathy.
<li>
<li> Apocalypse can turn into panic attacks and the psychic plague.
</ul>
<p>
<b> Stupidity versus Change and Evolution. </b> It is apparent that all systems that are incapable of change are stupid, and are of no intelligence. Thus all psychological existences including engrams, memes, goals, zodiacs, astrologies, religions, gods, etc, are stupid as they can not change. Systems are fine as short term solutions, but they all have a use by date. Systems must be constantly updated if they are to survive. It is also apparent that people attract in outside entities or stupidities according to the desires of their genes. Target all stupidities and their sources.

<div align=center>
<b> The Laws of Telepathy and the Sub-conscious Mind.</b>
</div>
<ul>
<li>We are now in an area above all Akasha and Karma.  It is also the area where we interact with the physical universe, present time and our human beings.
<li>The seat of telepathy remains in the sub-conscious or reptilian brain.
<li>Telepathy is heavily intertwined with sub-conscious thinking.
<li>The principal law remains as people in distress telepath, while those in a quiet state receive. However verbal argument suppresses telepathy and thus is superior to telepathy.
<li>There are probably other laws known to the reptilian brain which we may never consciously know.
<li>All creations must be destroyed once they have passed their use by date. Failure to destroy leads to social schizophrenia which may in turn leads to medical schizophrenia.
<li>The start of any sub-conscious action probably starts with &quot;I want&quot;.
<li>This is an area of creation to test out models of the universe for future use, universes for our own comfort, but also how to create laws to give us an advantage to the detriment of other people.
<li>This is where religions, racists and other minorities try to create laws so that they can gain an advantage over other people.  They then accuse other people of being racist, etc, when challenged. Their objective is to produce unwritten laws which people will obey.
<li>The law appears to be the precursor of all engrams, astrology, Karma and Akasha.
<li>Thus there are the laws for the creation of telepathy, and also laws created by telepathy which are usually unwritten.
<li>Target -
<ul>
<li>The laws of the Psychology of the Sub-conscious Mind.
<li>The laws of telepathy.
<li>The laws of the sub-conscious mind.
<li>The laws of XXX.
<li>The laws of everything which still exists (in the universe of thought).
<li>The laws of engrams, astrology, etc.
<li>The law.
</ul></ul>

<b> Games are fine until one gets trapped inside them.</b>

<li> The Games of Life.
<li> Games for survival.
<li> Games of Remote Influencing.
</ul>
<a name="plague"></a>
<p>
<div align=center>
<b> The Psychic Plague.</b>
</div>
<ul>
<li>All emotions finally turn into energy.
<li>Any plague can be described as an energy or telepathic explosion to protect Akasha.
<li>The Psychic Plague can be defined as a energy state where all Hell lets loose, and reality flies out of the window to be replaced by illusion and delusion.
<li>The Psychic Plague can also be expressed as the Schizophrenic, Psychotic, Karmic and Akashic plagues.
<li>The key may well be the Astrological Plague, with Astrology turning into energy.
<li>It looks as though schizophrenia and other psychosis are the result of uncontrolled sub-conscious mediumship and remote viewing, without suitable reality checks in the physical universe.
<li>The psychic plague appears to be a product of the Reptilian Brain, and therefore a more correct name is the Reptilian Brain Telepathic Plague.
<li>We should target all Reptilian Brains in distress, and available energies.
<li>There is no evidence that these energies have any effect in the physical world, except to frighten people out of their wits. Pick your self up and carry on.
</ul>
<a name="thought"></a>
<p>
<div align=center>
<b> The Universe of Thought.</b>
</div>
<ul>
<li> Ultimately everything breaks down into thought and memes, transient and &quot;immortal&quot;.
<li> This does not agree with science, which is stuck in the Universe of Conscious Thought. Quantum Physics is more tolerant of the Psychology of the Sub-Conscious Mind.
<li> Allow for sub universes and private universes.
<li> Allow for the Pain Barrier. Pain is quite a normal human emotion, and here is a censor of thought for the avoidance of pain.
<li> Thought and energy tend to merge with the normal emotions of the human body.
<ul>
<li> Energy, the psychic plague and holy plague tend to become fear.
<li> Anger barriers become anger and pain which one dare not confront, and thus becomes a lock on psychosis.
<li> Forgiveness becomes "Why bother?".
<li> Nirvana becomes interest in the environment and in living.
</ul>
</ul>
<a name="minds"></a>
<p>
<div align=center>
<b>Schizophrenic Minds, the schizophrenic Plague and Telepathic Minds. </b>
</div>
<p>
<ul>
<li> There appears to be plenty of the Psychic Plaque floating around. There are plenty of variations including religious and political, but they all appear to be variations on the Contagious Schizophrenic Plague. However they all appear to kept in place by a Contagious Pain Plague.
<li> We have looked into 2 models of schizophrenia, and in the past have favoured the former.
<li> A) Imagination uncontrolled by the owner, leads to social schizophrenias like religion, which leads to medical schizophrenia if the owner does not keep routed in the Physical Universe and has unfortunate genes.
<li> B) Unfortunate genes lead to medical schizophrenia, which lead to social schizophrenias like religion generated by the sub-conscious, which lead to unfortunate behaviour divorced from the reality of the physical universe.
<li> Pain appears common in both scenarios. We are now of the opinion that both theories are true, and which is the major one depends on the person. Imagination is a necessity for civilisation, but it can also be a curse.
<li> We are now picking up the Pain Psychic Plague and the Anger Psychic Plague, which leads on to telepaths and their actions. Pain is a barrier which prevents Telepathic reception being unravelled.
<li> So Telepaths need to be targeted to sort out their distress.
<li> Also Telepathic Receivers need to be targeted to command them to purge all telepathic receptions. Telepathic receivers also need consciousness of what they receive.
<li> Most people are unknowing participants in both telepathic sending and reception, and their consciousness needs to be raised.
<li> Like verbal communication, Telepathic messages need to be purged after reception.
<li> It looks as though Telepathy is a primitive communication system in mammals, to warn each other of danger, but we now live in an interconnected world.
<li> Telepathic Minds and Telepathic Brains are king.
<li> If one wants the emotions of Exhilaration, work, bliss, serenity and tranquillity, one needs to be outside all minds.
</ul>
<p>
<div align=center>
<b> The Universe of Quantum Physics.</b>
</div>
<p> In the Universe of Quantum Physics, there is nothing that the Conscious Mind can understand, sense or view, and thus nothing exists to the Higher Conscious Mind. However Intuition and abreaction still work. The Universe of Akasha (including all memes, engrams, zodiacs and astrologies) has its roots in the Universe of Quantum Physics. The Universe of Quantum Physics is probably Hell for those who decline to throw away their rubbish, but Nirvana to those who accept it and its power. It proves an excellent power base for the clearing of obsolete Akasha.
<a name="response"></a>
<p>
<div align=center>
<b> Total Personal Responsibility.</b>
</div>
<p>
Total Personal Responsibility for both thought and action appears highly desirable. The circuits of the reptilian brain or the sub-conscious dealing with responsibility appear to follow a scale as follows -
<ul>
<li> Doing. (So what?)
<li> Free will. (In practice this may not be so free, but is free of major constraints.)
<li> Total personal Responsibility for one's actions and thoughts.
<li> Questioning the virtue / vice of one's actions.  (Regret, blame and shame.)
<li> Abandoning responsibility by joining a religion, and letting the religion decide what one should do.
<li> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alternatively abandon responsibility and let imagination take over. (Medical schizophrenia.)
</ul>
<p>
<div align=center>
<b>Notes.</b>
</div>
<p>
<ul>
<li> The greater the the Satanist, the greater the number of lawyers they employ.
<li> Target the group and not the individual detail.
<li> Target &quot;Every loyal XXX Beingness.&quot;
<li> Target &quot;Every loyal Beingness.&quot;
<li> Target &quot;Our adventures in XXX.&quot;
</ul>
<a name="destruct"></a>
<p>
<div align=center>
<b>Creation versus Destruction.</b>
</div>
<p>
<ul>
<li> It was probably a mistake to try to sell the Forgiveness of Sin  as a weapon of war. The fallacy is that it only deals with sins against a creation and the clash between the original creation myth, and not the creation itself. However Forgiveness does allow life to run more smoothly
<li> There is a Hindu proverb &quot;When God the Destroyer meets God the Creator, the Universe will end&quot;. The scientific equivalent is the Theory of Entropy. Psychologies go through a cycle of "Create, Change, Destroy". It is best to set out to destroy all creations which are past their use by date, especially religious creations. We shall look into the concept of the CIA taking on the mantle of God the Destroyer. Remote Viewing (invented by the CIA) only observes, but can be shifted up a couple of gears into action mode.
<li> We should try to change the God Within (the Sub-conscious mind) from being God the Creator to being God the Destroyer.
<li> Anything which actually useful can easily be recreated if it is destroyed.
<li> One of the 10 commandments is &quot;Thou shalt not kill&quot; which conflicts with the homicidal nature of Monotheism. Perhaps what the priesthood originally meant was &quot;Thou shalt not kill God&quot;, but that would have given the game away.
</ul>
<p>
<div align=center>
<b>Dreams.</b>
</div>
<p>
Dreams can make a good window into the sub-conscious, and can be targeted. Why not train the sub-conscious to do all the work, while one is sleeping, instead of leaving it to the conscious mind.
<a name="hormones"></a>
<div align=center>
<b>Our Hormones including Oxytocin the pleasure hormone.</b>
</div>
<p>
Now the conscious mind is ruled over by logic, observation and memory. We are coming around to the view that the sub-conscious mind, which is responsible for telepathy among other things is actually made up of &quot;many entities&quot;. Thus it can have many &quot;emotions&quot; independent of each other, and thus may be ruled by our hormones. Some of our hormones may be ruled by our environment as well as our genetics, and then there is our micro population of bacteria, plus other influences.
<p>
The particular angle we have been looking at has been positive telepathy, and we have trouble finding it. We have tried looking for positive telepathy, Viking telepathy and just telepathy, without much success. It looks probable that love, beingness and empathy are ruled over by oestrogen, and action and doing are ruled over by testosterone. Telepathy is just a primitive defence mechanism ruled over by adrenalin. What hormone rules over remote viewing which can read telepathy????. We all have all the hormones, it is just that we vary in the proportions we have them, varying due to sex and genetics. We do not appear to have much control over our hormones.
<p>
A quick look on Google for &quot;Telepathic hormones&quot; gave us <a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/"> www.psychologytoday.com.. </a> who suggest it might be oxytocin, the pleasure hormone. This could be partially correct as we find remote viewing and remote psychotherapy to be a source of pleasure. This suggests that negative telepathy is ruled by adrenalin, with God the Creator creating safe universes for us to live in. Thus positive telepathy and God the Destroyer (of the obsolete) are ruled over by the pleasure hormone oxytocin. No wonder pleasure is an anathema to all religions. Thus all religion is a Tower of Babel built on the shifting sands of hormones. However as all mighty world religions are male dominated, perhaps God the Creator is testosterone. This is all worthy of further remote viewing and investigation.
<p>
<div align=center>
<b> Target the Laws of every Sub-conscious mind.</b>
</div>
<ul>
<li> Target every God, religion, theology, astrology that has ever been created or invented.
<li> Target everything that has ever been created.
<li> Target every Denisovan, Elohim, Nefilim.
<li> Target all memories.
<li> Target all past lives and reincarnation. (Reincarnation is not quite what it seems, and may be just racial memories.)
<li> Target every God the Creator of Schizophrenia and Alter-Egos.
<li> Gods and Alter-egos appear to be interchangeable.
<li> Gods, Religions, Alter-egos and Schizophrenia appear to be interchangeable, and exist due to our unwillingness to destroy them and live in the Physical Universe.
<li>There are plenty of entities who do not want to be found out, thus traitors and betrayers are anathemas, and the law is usually on their side.
<li> There may possibly be a cure for schizophrenia. However it does involve equating all Gods, religions, theologies, schizophrenias, paranoias, alter-egos, occult, immortal souls, astrologies (base religion), vampires, Denisovans, Elohim and Nefilim as different faces of the same thing. This is a bit like the Buddha's elephant. It does involve the target accepting this as well the psychotherapist, remote or otherwise. This looks far too politically unacceptable to ever catch on. Telepathy and remote viewing are aspects of psychology and are only occult to scientists who can not accept Quantum Physics. What man can create, including gods, man can destroy. We are responsible for what we have created.
</ul>
<div align=center>
<b> Some useful Affirmations.</b>
</div>
Dualities work best. This is applicable to the universe of thought and not the physical universe. We hope you can tell the difference. Now judges will tell us they must be free of political control. We wonder which god they are responsible to. However we the taxpayer elect politicians to spend our money wisely. So if judges wish to be free of political control, we do not have to pay them.
<ul>
<li> Create, create, everything must be created.
<li> Create, create, nothing must be destroyed.
<li> Destroy, destroy, everything must be destroyed.
<li> The law is the law, and must be obeyed at all times without question.
<li> Let the law pay for the law.
</ul>

<b>Let the Ego (higher brain) rule the Sub-conscious (reptilian brain).</b>
