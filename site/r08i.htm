<h3> R08. Sample Remote Viewing Protocols and Sessions. </h3> 
</div>
<p>
<b> Sample Military Remote Viewing Protocol </b>
<ul>
<li> Someone must request information on a Target. He writes the name of the target on a piece of paper, together with the time the viewer is supposed to look at. (Do not RV Nelson's Column before 1845 when it was built.) This is then put in a sealed envelope, and an 8 digit random number is written on the outside.
<p><li> The controller (the last thing he must do is control) or trainer takes the target, and links into the person requesting. These may be the same person.
<p><li> The controller sits down with the viewer. When the viewer is ready and in the right state of mind, he is given the random number co-ordinates. The viewer links back to the controller, and writes or tells his impressions.
<p><li> If the controller believes the viewer is on the right target, he may give limited confirmation and guidance which must be logged. (What is below ground, above the ground, around the target etc.)
<p><li> What the viewer expects the target to be is irrelevant, and should be written down first to get it out of the way. 
<p><li> All impressions must be written down. Anything not written down does not count.
<p><li> After viewing, identifying the target is irrelevant as the person requesting already knows. The incongruities seen are the important items. What the viewer believes the target to be should be written down to get it out of the way.
<p><li> In non military applications, the controller should reveal the identity of the target. In military applications, this is not always done. 
</ul>
<p>
<b> Sample Fun Remote Viewing Protocol </b>
<ul>
<li> All numbers and quantities given should be varied to suit local requirements.
<p><li> Set up a meeting of say 10 people in quiet non threatening surroundings.
<p><li> It is advisable to have a psychic defender to check people in, act as manager and make the coffee. Any remote viewing session invites interest from psychic outsiders who may dump their rubbish on you. Many of the military do not bother about defenders as they believe remote viewing runs on scientific principles, and then wonder why they get clobbered by the other side. It is the job of the defender to pick up any outside influence and return it to sender. Remote viewing groups do not last long without a defender. The defender should not take part in the session.
<p><li> The defender should have a list of about 20 random 8 digit numbers which do not look like telephone numbers. As people come in, he should get them to write their chosen target down on a piece of paper, together with the date and time to be viewed. When the participant is out of view, he should allocate a random number to it, and put this in an envelope. 
<p><li> Historic sites are usually good as there is plenty of emotion attached.
<p><li> Targets to be avoided by amateurs include people, military installations and ETs, as people can bite back. Many key military sites have their own defenders. Some military sites (like Roswell) are set up as fly traps for the unwary. MI5 are reasonably tolerant to members of the public, but the unforgivable sin is to try to look in in any way on a British military site.
<p><li> All targets should be within the comprehension of the participants. The structure of a protein molecule is a suitable target for organic chemists, but few other people. 
<p><li> A person is made up of body, mind and spirit. One's Guardian Angel is spirit as viewed by the body. In remote viewing, the body is only the vehicle for writting down notes, etc. All work is done by spirit or Guardian Angels. Minds must be ignored at all costs. One must try to be outside all minds.  
<p><li> The participants should come in peace and go in peace. Anything else invites retribution.
<p><li> Anyone on tranquilisers or any other psychiatric drugs, should not indulge in remote viewing. 
<p><li> When the meeting eventually starts, the defender should appoint each participant in turn to be the trainer. The trainer is given an envelope at random, and should open it, look at the target written down, give the participants the random number written, and put it back in the envelope.
<p><li> The participant should be given 3 minutes to write their impressions down on paper.
<ul>
<li> What they predict the target to be, which is irrelevant as the trainer already knows it. They should write this down to get it out of the way.
<li> First impressions are the most important and least liable to be contaminated by minds.
<li> All impressions such as colour, smell, pictures, impressions, incongruities or what ever can be picked up, must be written down.
<li> If in doubt, write it down. It might be the real incongruity.
<li> The participant should look underground, at ground level, above ground, out from the centre and into the centre. This may not be appropriate for a flying saucer or something abstract, but will do for most terrestrial objects. 
<li> What they believe the target to be, which is irrelevant as the trainer already knows it. This should be written down to get it out of the way.
</ul>
<p><li> At the end of the 3 minutes, the defender should signal that time is up and allow people a few more seconds to write down any last minute impressions. 
<p><li> The trainer should then reveal the target and ask around for impressions.
<p><li> Be generous with other people's impressions as they might have come up with the real incongruity. 
<p><li> Results should be scored in 3 ways. Rivalry will reduce scores.
<ul>
<li> The viewer on whether he or other people believe he has a hit.
<li> The trainer on the number of people who have hits.
<li> The person who gave the target on the number of people who have hits.
</ul>
<p><li> Repeat the process with a new trainer until everyone has had a go.
<p><li> When setting up a repeat session, choose the participants in the following order.
<ul>
<li> The host.
<li> Those who have scored as success breeds success.
<li> New members believed to be a little psychic.
<li> New members who are not believed to be psychic.
<li> Those who did not score. 
</ul> 
<li> Successful participants may receive a shock from being successful. One must take responsibility for what one knows and can do. Do not try another session until one has repaired their responsibility. The defender may be of assistance.
<li> Should anyone believe remote viewing to be an invasion of privacy or a pointless activity, then they have probably been working on the wrong targets. It is up to them to point out to the group what are useful targets. This may result in the group splitting into 2 groups for separate purposes. 
<li> Should anyone receive unwelcome visitors, psychic or human, or detect anything else untoward, this should be reported to the defender immediatly.
