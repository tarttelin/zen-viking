The following should not be regarded as accurate, complete or in the right order.
<ul>
<li> Love has many guises, such as empathy and tough love.
<li> Love your neighbour, and he will probably love you.
<li> Hate your neighbour, and you will probably get what you deserve, a lesson most priests have yet to learn when dealing with rival religions.
<li> Survival ensures the continuation of life. while love makes things comfortable.
<li> Black and religious magic is for losers.
<li> Healing is dependent on love, and can be regarded as dynamic love.
<li> Best results should be expected from psychosomatics. However complaints due to physical sources and entropy do gather rubbish around them.
<li> Target everyone greater than love or healing, as well as particular ailments in the general population even if they are your own.
<li> To heal a target, one must be on a higher level of enlightenment.
<li> Healing and love are in the universe of thought, and there is no evidence that they can operate in the physical universe. There is little proof that physical telekinesis exists, but love and healing do make life comfortable.
</ul>
